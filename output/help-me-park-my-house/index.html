  I've decided that, based on location and other factors, I'd like to find another spot to park my
  tiny RV in Portland. Preferably, I'd like to be somewhere within the following boundaries:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>N:</strong>
    South of Killingsworth St, east of Interstate Ave, north of Tillamook St.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NE:</strong>
    South of Killingsworth St, north of Tillamook St.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SE:</strong>
    North of Powell Blvd, west of 12th Ave, east of Cesar Chavez Blvd
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All I would ask is to use your electricity (via extension cord), to shower in your bathroom, and to use
  your laundry machines (if present). My RV is only 20'8", so it only takes up slightly more room than a
  standard parking spot. It's also downright adorable (pictured above).
</p>
<p>
  Though what I'm envisioning is an arrangement as an auxiliary dwelling alongside an existing residence,
  I'd also be open to a spot in a parking lot, etc if I were close enough to a facility for bathing.
</p>
<p>
  Please spread the word! I'm willing to pay whatever the landowner or tenants think is fair. I'm quiet,
  considerate, and clean. Thank you for your support!
</p>
