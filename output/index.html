          <p>
            It's amusing to observe the patterns of my anxiety, as correlated with
            the weather and scenery. Portland's climate generally leaves me feeling
            depressed and wanting more. Its urban landscape is as near to perfect as
            an American city can be, but it might edge too far into the category of
            &quot;major metropolitan area&quot; for me to maintain a consistent semblance
            of sanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monterey's cool, sunny climate combined with its seemingly lacksidasical seafaring populous
            made it a damn near perfect place to reset my head. And now, being thrusted back
            into another major metropolitan area, I'm reminded why I left in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every California city is comprised of equal parts slums, picket fences, and ugly car-oriented
            commercialism. Even Berkeley, a haven for progressivism, is a congested beheamoth of a place.
            Don't get me wrong: Californian urbanites are generally lovely people. It's just that
            the car-oriented, sprawling nature of their urban areas propagates a unique brand of
            California aggression. Everyone here is in a hurry to get somewhere, and when they're done
            being somewhere, they're in a hurry to get somewhere else. It's as if someone put blinders on their
            car windshields and they're living oblivious to the fact they live in the most beautiful
            place on earth. Or it's because one look out their car windshields means another In-N-Out Burger,
            strip mall, or traffic interchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there were a brand name for this perpetual state of rushedness and instant
            gratification, it would be dubbed San Jose&tm;. In less than 24 hours, I've witnessed
            a man in a Lexus blast his horn at a woman walking in a parking lot as if his weekend might
            be ruined if not for his on-time arrival at the local BevMo!. I've counted the BMW's, the Lexuses (Lexi?),
            the Mercedes-Benz's, and the sad, balding men who drive them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there's one thing I've re-learned in my travels, it's that the most vital ingredient to
            happiness is what I like to call <em>experiential diversity</em>. Nostalgic thoughts act as
            <a href="http://veryevolved.com/2009/02/neuroscience-and-nostalgia/">natural antidepressants</a>.
            Marketers convince you that their product or service will make you feel at home or
            bear resemblance to &quot;the good old days.&quot; They're just targeting
            the same part of the brain stimulated the first night home after a peaceful vacation or the moment two
            loved ones are reconnected at the airport. What advertising and commercialism <em>does not</em> grant us
            is sustained diversity in experiences, thoughts, and ideas. If our hunter-gatherer roots aren't
            indicative enough of humankind's tendency toward exploration and conquest, then the blood-soaked founding of the United
            States should be. Denying our primal need to explore is to deny our humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Never let the people on television, in your computer, on billboards, or on the radio persuade you
            their way is the right way. It's a certainty they're trying to take your money, and it's a near certainty
            that they feel the same longing and entrapment as you do when you listen. I've found
            a new kind of fulfillment, and it comes from within.

            Winds battered the side of my van through the night, perched
            atop a hill in Monterey County. I awoke to a rainy windshield,
            a crisp, dewey morning with a glowing potential to blossom
            into a beautiful sunny afternoon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent Thursday and Friday working and cycling. The Laguna Seca
            Recreation Area is home to the Mazda Laguna Seca raceway, which served
            as a veritable road cyclist's utopia with its maze of paved and barely-traveled
            access roads around the campus. For two days, I cheerfully alternated
            between cycling and working every few hours. I hardly spoke to a soul, but this
            solidarity gave me new perspective.

          </p>
          <p>
            I awoke bright and early this morning&mdash;5:30 is the earliest I've woken up voluntarily in years.
            After committing a couple hours of work, I packed up the RV and headed out. My first stop was one of
            two gas stations in Big Sur. And at only $5.25 per gallon, it was quite the bargain. The shopkeepers
            had a certain rural charm and genuine friendly demeanor that I'm not sure I've experienced elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            My trip was to be simple in form, but burdensome in execution. Two hours driving, according to Google Maps,
            will carry an automobile from Big Sur to San Luis Obispo. What Google <em>didn't</em> know about was the
            rockslide and road closure I'd encounter a quarter of the way there.
          </p>
          <p>
            US-1 runs along the perimeter of the Pacific coast. Outlets are sparse: There are stretches where one can drive
            forty miles without encountering a road leading inland. I was on one of those very stretches when
            I reached a &quot;Road Closed&quot; sign and a portly woman informing me (in that very same rural charm
            and friendly demeanor) that a rock the size of a large vehicle had fallen square into the highway, and
            that it was to be dynamited later that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so, I set off in the northward direction, anxiously steering the windy, hilly intestine of the California
            coast. Since I enjoyed my grocery shopping experience in Monterey, I figured I'd set up shop in the area for the week.
            Monterey itself is quite a lot like all the California cities I've visited: Bright, car-crowded, noisy, yet still
            charming. I was tempted to try spending the night in my RV on a city street, but my waste tanks needed emptying
            and I wanted to retire to a peaceful place after the day's driving and working. I worked at a local coffee shop,
            bought enough groceries to last the rest of the week, and headed to Laguna Seca Recreation Area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite sharing land with a race track, Laguna Seca is a gorgeous
            hilltop campground with full hookups and just about the best view out your window you've ever seen. I'm very much
            looking forward to spending my workday atop a hill in the peaceful sunshine.

          <p>
            I awoke Sunday morning to near-freezing temperatures in the parking lot of the Walmart in Yreka, California.
            Much to my surprise, I was the first RV to leave the lot in the morning. Armed with a fresh box of granola and
            unfettered by the bag of garbage and rotting produce left in the parking lot trash bin, I once again headed south
            on I-5.
          </p>
          <p>
            Snow turned to rain turned to green forests turned to barren desert, and before I knew it, I was at a truck stop
            in the Central Valley. It amuses me that entire towns form in California with the sole purpose of providing Interstate travelers
            with amenities. Also amusing is how unfazed these desert dwellers are by living an existence which would have proven impossible only
            a hundred years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then I crossed the California Aqueduct. This is one of those fables I was told was true, but conveniently
            ignored. But there it was, a flowing network of oasises (oases?) feeding the fairytale city of Los Angeles,
            transforming temperate into desert and desert into temperate. According to Wikipedia, the California Water Project
            is the single biggest net consumer of energy in the state, despite it also being one of the largest producers.
            I'll put this in the categories of <em>very cool</em> and <em>totally not going to last another century</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I arrived in Monterey at around 5:00 pm and stopped off for some groceries; Big Sur is located on a stretch of
            US-1 with no outlets for miles, so if I wanted to eat more than pub food I had to ensure I was well-stocked. Monterey
            immediately struck me as a place I could stand to spend some time. Small-town, coastal mentality paired with
            a seemingly classic Californian aesthetic made it a place to which I'd like to return.
          </p>
          <p>
            The drive along US-1 was both arduous and one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,
            probably second only to the last time I drove it. Last time, my vessel was a rented Mustang, and could
            maneuver the windy, tight turns with ease. This time, it was a bit of a different story. I don't know why
            motorists on US-1 would <em>want</em> to go faster than 25 MPH. Speeds any greater don't provide the
            driver with an opportunity to dart their eyes westward at the coast's majesty. I must have pulled into four
            or five lookout points along the way to let Joe American and his American Family speed by to their next
            destination, racing as if he had to see the entirety of the California coast in only a day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I arrived at my campsite and plugged in my land yacht as if it were a household appliance. I'm very
            eager to have her outfitted with solar panels so I'm not reliant on 110V power. I'm convinced that
            12V is the way of the future, and that portably powered microhomes are a means toward sustained
            energy independence. Anyway, my stay here has cleared my head, provided me with a fresh supply of
            oxygen, and allowed me to recharge before I plunge into the bowels of Southern California.

            Today I embarked on the first leg of my journey to find America or some nice weather
            or whatever the hell I'm looking for barrelling down Interstate 5 at a whopping 45-65 MPH
            (my VW is a 4-cylinder; give me a break). I set my sights on the Mt. Shasta area of
            Northern California as a reasonable stopping point, and I sought to cross one particular
            nagging American dream off my very long bucket list. Tonight, I'm sleeping at Walmart.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, my experience has been nothing but&hellip;what I thought it would be. There's the overweight employees
            and patrons, not entirely unkempt but as 'kempt' as required by Sir Sam Walton. And then
            there's the haggard old woman waving hello to the greeter at the front door. Yreka is a
            town of fewer than eight thousand; I suppose everyone knows your name in a place like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a bizarre feeling to drive into a Walmart parking lot and then realize you've got your
            entire house with you. As soon as I pulled in, I cranked on the propane and put on a pot of
            tea. Chamomile, to put me fast asleep to catch the first crack of sunlight pouring over the
            mountain. A Walmart patron might have suggested I take some 5-Hour Energy and push through
            till dawn, but I think I'll take their pimply-nosed complexion as a clear sign that sleep
            is a better option.

            It's been raining and hovering around 40&deg;F for the past two weeks straight here in Portland.
            As a result, my trusted land yacht (RV) has faced the plight of condensation in all its orifices.
            And so, I figured, my wet carpet must surely be a result of it raining inside, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plastic tubing connecting my water pump to the faucet had sprung a slow leak, and was dripping
            water all over the inside of my kitchenette unit, down onto the carpet in front of my bed. I'd
            impressed myself countless times with my seeming natural handyman talent (this kid deals in bits and
            bytes typically), but this one was too much stress for me to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            My trusty Craigslist contractor came to the rescue, but had a caveat: The carpets needed to be ripped
            out. With that much water seeping through to the subfloor, chances of salvaging the wood below with
            the carpets in place were slim. And so, reluctantly, I started the process I had hoped to put off
            until I reached sunnier pastures. It was time to go bamboo.

            Their work is most prominent in the interior of <a href="http://coava.myshopify.com">Coava Roasters</a>,

          <h4>Fat and unable to move</h4>
          <p>
            I was getting fat. Not around the waistline -- around my apartment. With two bicycles (down from four), three
            24"+ computer monitors, two computer workstations, numerous gadgets, a small studio's worth of music production
            gear, and a closet full of clothes I never wore, I was destined to live life reluctantly renewing leases for fear
            of moving on. <em>What would I do with all this stuff?</em> The idea terrified me. It terrified me so much that
            I'd have nightmares about never being able to leave Portland. You know, the ones where Sam Adams erects a wall
            around the city and David Hasselhof tries to save us. Or something.
          </p>
          <h4>Down by the river</h4>
          <p>
            Rewind back to 2002. A simpler time. A time where a 17-year-old high school senior could make his daily allowance
            working for the local supermarket and dream about one day living in a van. <em>&quot;I could go anywhere, anytime!&quot;</em>,
            I'd think to myself. <em>&quot;I could even install a computer inside, and wardrive for fresh wi-fi hotspots around town!&quot;</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But alas, vans cost thousands of dollars, and I didn't have any credit... or thousands of dollars. Dreams crushed.
          </p>
          <h4>A fear of flight</h4>
          <p>
            When I was in my early twenties, I'd fly everywhere without a thought. In 2008 I flew to and from Europe three
            times in the course of only a few weeks. I loved to fly. But then...
          </p>
          <p>
            Then this pesky part of my brain called my frontal lobe developed. All of the sudden flying was for the birds,
            stepping too close to the edge of cliffs was a death wish, and earthquakes were common in Portland, Oregon. And so
            ended my era of easy, fast transcontinental travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forever stranded 3,000 miles away from home, with an unnerving desire to see something different when I awaken in the morning,
            I decided it was time to fulfill my teenage pipe dream. And so far, I've never been more fulfilled by a decision in my life.
          </p>
          <h4>Criminally small</h4>
          <p>
            Perusing the zoning ordinances for most urban areas, you'll find that the minimum square footage for a residence is somewhere in the
            vicinity of 400 square feet. You'll also find that (in Portland, at least) parking your motorhome on the street overnight is illegal.
            And then there's the city's camping laws, which prohibit camping in a private yard for longer than 14 consecutive days. In my opinion,
            these laws do more to disturb the peace than protect it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we'll see what happens. The worst that can come of this is I have to move my house, which, at this point, involves putting it in drive.
            I'm making it a point to be very respectful to my neighbors and yard-mates, so hopefully it won't be a problem for the short duration I
            plan to remain in Portland.
          </p>
          <h4>You say RV. I say land yacht.</h4>
          <p>
            If you think I'm sacrificing comfort or style living in less than 100 square feet, think again. I've only had my RV for a week, and already
            I've installed a Bluetooth-ready car stereo, assembled a custom computer workstation made out of an IKEA kitchen table, a memory foam mattress,
            a magnetic spice rack with magnetic on-wall storage for metallic tools, an area rug, 4G wireless Internet access, and LED lighting. This makes
            my RV less a trashy mobile home and more a classy land yacht, ready for adventure and equipped for my live/work lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot take credit for my inspiration in this endeavor, though. Most of the reassurance that "everything is going to be okay" comes from
            <a href="http://tynan.com">Tynan</a>, who wrote an excellent book about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tiniest-Mansion-Live-Luxury-ebook/dp/B006XLK2LW">living
            in a small RV</a>. And then there's <a href="http://livinginrv.com">Mikko Kemppe</a>, who coined the phrase <em>Urban Mobile Lifestyle</em> and lives in a
            Winnebago Era. He hasn't updated his site in awhile, so I'm curious what he's up to now.
          </p>
          <p>
            So there you have it. I'm not sure what's to come of my grand experiment, but I can tell you it'll be more exciting than sitting at home
            watching reruns of <em>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>. Not that I won't miss The Gang...

            I have fond memories of dreaming away during my teenage youth at the prospect of one day finding a way
            to make a living on the road. Of one day building my ideal vessel: A veritable hacker's paradise on wheels.
            And yet, somehow I've always found a way to excuse myself from the dream's pursuit and realization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well not this year, damnit. That's right. In Summer 2012, I set sail on the open road in a yet-to-be-converted
            Sprinter van, equipped with most of the amenities of home and bearing one overwhelmingly novel feature no
            condo or apartment ever could: A V6 engine and a set of wheels.

            After much frustration with absymal load times on my Rails 3.1 application when running on Ruby 1.9.2,
            I decided it was high time to upgrade to 1.9.3 to take advantage of its new hash-based require scheme. Turns out
            it was going to take an entire afternoon because of an issue with the <code>pg</code> gem's configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're having the same problem, try the following:
          </p>
          <pre>$ rvm use 1.9.3-p0
          $ gem uninstall pg # uninstall all versions
          $ gem install pg  --with-pg-config=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/bin/pg_config</pre>
          <p>
            Essentially, you need to be explicit about Homebrew's Postgres installation so you don't end up using
            the default Mac installation.

            My brother stumbled upon my last post,
            <a href="/2413224cf1c6f2206c3f7156419b68a54fc67acd/">We have the capacity for renaissance</a>,
            and suggested I read Seth Godin's book <em>Linchpin</em>.
            Only thirty-some-odd pages into it and I'm realizing he's preaching
            what I so-humbly prophetized five years ago: My generation's affluence
            depends not upon employment, following, or obedience, but upon
            self-reliance, leadership, and challenging the status quo. For the first time in
            our industrial society, Godin proclaims, the proletariat owns the means of production.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my last days of my undergraduate study, I held an internship at a small software
            company in Ithaca, New York. When I decided to up and move across the country to Portland,
            I was bold enough to inquire about telecommuting. They said yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What an exciting, new prospect! I had heard of transcriptionists and architects taking their work home with them,
            but the idea that I could work among a team of four engineers sitting in a seat
            3,000 miles and three timezones away seemed like a fantasy. This was in 2007 a time when VoIP was in its
            barely-useful infancy. Source control systems were hosted on dedicated servers and lacked the social facilities
            which make GitHub such a joy to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving to Portland, in retrospect, was like sailing the maiden voyage of a vessel to a new world.
            One free from the shackles of 9-5 work schedules, daily commutes, lacking office kitchen facilities,
            distracting water cooler jabber, and most importantly, <em>showing up for work</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents' generation was the Worker Bee Generation. Throughout my childhood,
            my parents preached higher education not as a means for academic enrichment, but
            as a means toward gainful employment. It's not their fault they were wrong to assume
            polite obedience and good grades would bear our generation's livings. It is our
            responsibility to adjust our attitudes and act in accordance with our brave new economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are thoughtworkers. Whereas a steel worker's hands are easily replaced by another's hands, the
            thoughtworker's mind is irreplaceable and irreplicable. Manual and clerical labor are mere <em>facilities</em>
            to assist creative people to realize their visions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are the new elite. We have the power to shift opinion, to automate businesses, to create and topple
            entire industries with our minds and some circuitry. And we're doing it from your neighborhood coffee shop,
            your cocktail bar, your park's picnic table, and the beach.
          </p>
          <p>

            So frequently I find myself in awe over the tools available for content creation and
            distribution&dash;tools which might have cost the average worker's annual salary only a decade ago.
            The Internet has granted nearly everyone the capacity to realize and disseminate the ideas in their hearts and minds
            in a way we've never known in any culture, ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why then, do we trend toward consumption-centric use patterns with our new technology? I consider myself prolific,
            but I still find myself checking my Facebook and Twitter feeds constantly, as if this moment of my life is
            incomplete. We flock toward the mundane minutae of image macros and top ten lists despite their obvious irrelevance
            to profound betterment of our lives.
          </p>

            Each and every one of us has the capacity to create. What will you make today?

          <a href="http://eliasmoniker.com"><strong>Elias Moniker</strong></a>'s debut album, <strong>The A.K.A</strong>. is available on CD. As in, I've got 1,000 of them in my closet and
          it'd be great to send them to eager ears. The A.K.A. makes a great stocking stuffer!
