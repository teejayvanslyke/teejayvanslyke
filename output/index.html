            My friends are doing their best to support me. My girlfriend has been a guiding light through the process.
            My parents think I'm insane. Regardless of opinion, I'm now living in a 1995 Winnebago Rialta.
          </p>
          <h4>Fat and unable to move</h4>
          <p>
            I was getting fat. Not around the waistline -- around my apartment. With two bicycles (down from four), three
            24"+ computer monitors, two computer workstations, numerous gadgets, a small studio's worth of music production
            gear, and a closet full of clothes I never wore, I was destined to live life reluctantly renewing leases for fear
            of moving on. <em>What would I do with all this stuff?</em> The idea terrified me. It terrified me so much that
            I'd have nightmares about never being able to leave Portland. You know, the ones where Sam Adams erects a wall
            around the city and David Hasselhof tries to save us. Or something.
          </p>
          <h4>Down by the river</h4>
          <p>
            Rewind back to 2002. A simpler time. A time where a 17-year-old high school senior could make his daily allowance
            working for the local supermarket and dream about one day living in a van. <em>&quot;I could go anywhere, anytime!&quot;</em>,
            I'd think to myself. <em>&quot;I could even install a computer inside, and wardrive for fresh wi-fi hotspots around town!&quot;</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But alas, vans cost thousands of dollars, and I didn't have any credit... or thousands of dollars. Dreams crushed.
          </p>
          <h4>A fear of flight</h4>
          <p>
            When I was in my early twenties, I'd fly everywhere without a thought. In 2008 I flew to and from Europe three
            times in the course of only a few weeks. I loved to fly. But then...
          </p>
          <p>
            Then this pesky part of my brain called my frontal lobe developed. All of the sudden flying was for the birds,
            stepping too close to the edge of cliffs was a death wish, and earthquakes were common in Portland, Oregon. And so
            ended my era of easy, fast transcontinental travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forever stranded 3,000 miles away from home, with an unnerving desire to see something different when I awaken in the morning,
            I decided it was time to fulfill my thkjeenage pipe dream. And so far, I've never been more fulfilled by a decision in my life.
          </p>
          <h4>Criminally small</h4>
          <p>
            Perusing the zoning ordinances for most urban areas, you'll find that the minimum square footage for a residence is somewhere in the
            vicinity of 400 square feet. You'll also find that (in Portland, at least) parking your motorhome on the street overnight is illegal.
            And then there's the city's camping laws, which prohibit camping in a private yard for longer than 14 consecutive days. In my opinion,
            these laws do more to disturb the peace than protect it.

            I have fond memories of dreaming away during my teenage youth at the prospect of one day finding a way
            to make a living on the road. Of one day building my ideal vessel: A veritable hacker's paradise on wheels.
            And yet, somehow I've always found a way to excuse myself from the dream's pursuit and realization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well not this year, damnit. That's right. In Summer 2012, I set sail on the open road in a yet-to-be-converted
            Sprinter van, equipped with most of the amenities of home and bearing one overwhelmingly novel feature no
            condo or apartment ever could: A V6 engine and a set of wheels.

          <p>
            After much frustration with absymal load times on my Rails 3.1 application when running on Ruby 1.9.2,
            I decided it was high time to upgrade to 1.9.3 to take advantage of its new hash-based require scheme. Turns out
            it was going to take an entire afternoon because of an issue with the <code>pg</code> gem's configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're having the same problem, try the following:
          </p>
          <pre>$ rvm use 1.9.3-p0
          $ gem uninstall pg # uninstall all versions
          $ gem install pg  --with-pg-config=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/bin/pg_config</pre>
          <p>
            Essentially, you need to be explicit about Homebrew's Postgres installation so you don't end up using
            the default Mac installation.
          </p>
          <p>I hope this helps. Happy holidays!</p>

            My brother stumbled upon my last post,
            <a href="/2413224cf1c6f2206c3f7156419b68a54fc67acd/">We have the capacity for renaissance</a>,
            and suggested I read Seth Godin's book <em>Linchpin</em>.
            Only thirty-some-odd pages into it and I'm realizing he's preaching
            what I so-humbly prophetized five years ago: My generation's affluence
            depends not upon employment, following, or obedience, but upon
            self-reliance, leadership, and challenging the status quo. For the first time in
            our industrial society, Godin proclaims, the proletariat owns the means of production.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my last days of my undergraduate study, I held an internship at a small software
            company in Ithaca, New York. When I decided to up and move across the country to Portland,
            I was bold enough to inquire about telecommuting. They said yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What an exciting, new prospect! I had heard of transcriptionists and architects taking their work home with them,
            but the idea that I could work among a team of four engineers sitting in a seat
            3,000 miles and three timezones away seemed like a fantasy. This was in 2007 a time when VoIP was in its
            barely-useful infancy. Source control systems were hosted on dedicated servers and lacked the social facilities
            which make GitHub such a joy to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving to Portland, in retrospect, was like sailing the maiden voyage of a vessel to a new world.
            One free from the shackles of 9-5 work schedules, daily commutes, lacking office kitchen facilities,
            distracting water cooler jabber, and most importantly, <em>showing up for work</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents' generation was the Worker Bee Generation. Throughout my childhood,
            my parents preached higher education not as a means for academic enrichment, but
            as a means toward gainful employment. It's not their fault they were wrong to assume
            polite obedience and good grades would bear our generation's livings. It is our
            responsibility to adjust our attitudes and act in accordance with our brave new economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are thoughtworkers. Whereas a steel worker's hands are easily replaced by another's hands, the
            thoughtworker's mind is irreplaceable and irreplicable. Manual and clerical labor are mere <em>facilities</em>
            to assist creative people to realize their visions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are the new elite. We have the power to shift opinion, to automate businesses, to create and topple
            entire industries with our minds and some circuitry. And we're doing it from your neighborhood coffee shop,
            your cocktail bar, your park's picnic table, and the beach.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's so fucking cool.

            So frequently I find myself in awe over the tools available for content creation and
            distribution&dash;tools which might have cost the average worker's annual salary only a decade ago.
            The Internet has granted nearly everyone the capacity to realize and disseminate the ideas in their hearts and minds
            in a way we've never known in any culture, ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why then, do we trend toward consumption-centric use patterns with our new technology? I consider myself prolific,
            but I still find myself checking my Facebook and Twitter feeds constantly, as if this moment of my life is
            incomplete. We flock toward the mundane minutae of image macros and top ten lists despite their obvious irrelevance
            to profound betterment of our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each and every one of us has the capacity to create. What will you make today?

          to add <a href="http://wweek.com">Willamette Week</a> and <a href="http://calagator.org">Calagator</a> support 
          as well. Check it out!

          <a href="http://eliasmoniker.com"><strong>Elias Moniker</strong></a>'s debut album, <strong>The A.K.A</strong>. is available on CD. As in, I've got 1,000 of them in my closet and
          it'd be great to send them to eager ears. The A.K.A. makes a great stocking stuffer!
