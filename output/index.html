          <p>
            Today I embarked on the first leg of my journey to find America or some nice weather
            or whatever the hell I'm looking for barrelling down Interstate 5 at a whopping 45-65 MPH
            (my VW is a 4-cylinder; give me a break). I set my sights on the Mt. Shasta area of
            Northern California as a reasonable stopping point, and I sought to cross one particular
            nagging American dream off my very long bucket list. Tonight, I'm sleeping at Walmart.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, my experience has been nothing but&hellip;what I thought it would be. There's the overweight employees
            and patrons, not entirely unkempt but as 'kempt' as required by Sir Sam Walton. And then
            there's the haggard old woman waving hello to the greeter at the front door. Yreka is a
            town of fewer than eight thousand; I suppose everyone knows your name in a place like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a bizarre feeling to drive into a Walmart parking lot and then realize you've got your
            entire house with you. As soon as I pulled in, I cranked on the propane and put on a pot of
            tea. Chamomile, to put me fast asleep to catch the first crack of sunlight pouring over the
            mountain. A Walmart patron might have suggested I take some 5-Hour Energy and push through
            till dawn, but I think I'll take their pimply-nosed complexion as a clear sign that sleep
            is a better option.
          </p>

            Here's to a good night's rest.

            It's been raining and hovering around 40&deg;F for the past two weeks straight here in Portland.
            As a result, my trusted land yacht (RV) has faced the plight of condensation in all its orifices.
            And so, I figured, my wet carpet must surely be a result of it raining inside, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plastic tubing connecting my water pump to the faucet had sprung a slow leak, and was dripping
            water all over the inside of my kitchenette unit, down onto the carpet in front of my bed. I'd
            impressed myself countless times with my seeming natural handyman talent (this kid deals in bits and
            bytes typically), but this one was too much stress for me to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            My trusty Craigslist contractor came to the rescue, but had a caveat: The carpets needed to be ripped
            out. With that much water seeping through to the subfloor, chances of salvaging the wood below with
            the carpets in place were slim. And so, reluctantly, I started the process I had hoped to put off
            until I reached sunnier pastures. It was time to go bamboo.

          <h4>Wood Jerry! Wood!</h4>
          <p>
            At the inception of my <a href="/a-grand-lifestyle-experiment">grand lifestyle experiment</a>, I decided
            I wanted to remodel most of my RV with gorgeous hardwoods from <a href="http://bamboorevolution.com">Bamboo Revolution</a>.
            Their work is most prominent in the interior of <a href="http://coava.myshopify.com">Coava Roasters</a>,
            with which they happen to share a space. When I saw it, I fell in love.
          </p>
          <p>
            The installation is still a work in progress, but I have a hunch the improvement will be night and day.
            I don't know what kind of masochist wants carpet installed in their home, but I'm glad to make a swift exit
            from that club.

            As much as I'll enjoy campgrounds some of the time, I'd love it if I could park my gorgeous land yacht in your

            My friends are doing their best to support me. My girlfriend has been a guiding light through the process.
            My parents think I'm insane. Regardless of opinion, I'm now living in a 1995 Winnebago Rialta.
          </p>
          <h4>Fat and unable to move</h4>
          <p>
            I was getting fat. Not around the waistline -- around my apartment. With two bicycles (down from four), three
            24"+ computer monitors, two computer workstations, numerous gadgets, a small studio's worth of music production
            gear, and a closet full of clothes I never wore, I was destined to live life reluctantly renewing leases for fear
            of moving on. <em>What would I do with all this stuff?</em> The idea terrified me. It terrified me so much that
            I'd have nightmares about never being able to leave Portland. You know, the ones where Sam Adams erects a wall
            around the city and David Hasselhof tries to save us. Or something.
          </p>
          <h4>Down by the river</h4>
          <p>
            Rewind back to 2002. A simpler time. A time where a 17-year-old high school senior could make his daily allowance
            working for the local supermarket and dream about one day living in a van. <em>&quot;I could go anywhere, anytime!&quot;</em>,
            I'd think to myself. <em>&quot;I could even install a computer inside, and wardrive for fresh wi-fi hotspots around town!&quot;</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But alas, vans cost thousands of dollars, and I didn't have any credit... or thousands of dollars. Dreams crushed.
          </p>
          <h4>A fear of flight</h4>
          <p>
            When I was in my early twenties, I'd fly everywhere without a thought. In 2008 I flew to and from Europe three
            times in the course of only a few weeks. I loved to fly. But then...
          </p>
          <p>
            Then this pesky part of my brain called my frontal lobe developed. All of the sudden flying was for the birds,
            stepping too close to the edge of cliffs was a death wish, and earthquakes were common in Portland, Oregon. And so
            ended my era of easy, fast transcontinental travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forever stranded 3,000 miles away from home, with an unnerving desire to see something different when I awaken in the morning,
            I decided it was time to fulfill my teenage pipe dream. And so far, I've never been more fulfilled by a decision in my life.
          </p>
          <h4>Criminally small</h4>
          <p>
            Perusing the zoning ordinances for most urban areas, you'll find that the minimum square footage for a residence is somewhere in the
            vicinity of 400 square feet. You'll also find that (in Portland, at least) parking your motorhome on the street overnight is illegal.
            And then there's the city's camping laws, which prohibit camping in a private yard for longer than 14 consecutive days. In my opinion,
            these laws do more to disturb the peace than protect it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we'll see what happens. The worst that can come of this is I have to move my house, which, at this point, involves putting it in drive.
            I'm making it a point to be very respectful to my neighbors and yard-mates, so hopefully it won't be a problem for the short duration I
            plan to remain in Portland.
          </p>
          <h4>You say RV. I say land yacht.</h4>
          <p>
            If you think I'm sacrificing comfort or style living in less than 100 square feet, think again. I've only had my RV for a week, and already
            I've installed a Bluetooth-ready car stereo, assembled a custom computer workstation made out of an IKEA kitchen table, a memory foam mattress,
            a magnetic spice rack with magnetic on-wall storage for metallic tools, an area rug, 4G wireless Internet access, and LED lighting. This makes
            my RV less a trashy mobile home and more a classy land yacht, ready for adventure and equipped for my live/work lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot take credit for my inspiration in this endeavor, though. Most of the reassurance that "everything is going to be okay" comes from
            <a href="http://tynan.com">Tynan</a>, who wrote an excellent book about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tiniest-Mansion-Live-Luxury-ebook/dp/B006XLK2LW">living
            in a small RV</a>. And then there's <a href="http://livinginrv.com">Mikko Kemppe</a>, who coined the phrase <em>Urban Mobile Lifestyle</em> and lives in a
            Winnebago Era. He hasn't updated his site in awhile, so I'm curious what he's up to now.
          </p>
          <p>
            So there you have it. I'm not sure what's to come of my grand experiment, but I can tell you it'll be more exciting than sitting at home
            watching reruns of <em>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>. Not that I won't miss The Gang...

            I have fond memories of dreaming away during my teenage youth at the prospect of one day finding a way
            to make a living on the road. Of one day building my ideal vessel: A veritable hacker's paradise on wheels.
            And yet, somehow I've always found a way to excuse myself from the dream's pursuit and realization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well not this year, damnit. That's right. In Summer 2012, I set sail on the open road in a yet-to-be-converted
            Sprinter van, equipped with most of the amenities of home and bearing one overwhelmingly novel feature no
            condo or apartment ever could: A V6 engine and a set of wheels.

          <p>
            After much frustration with absymal load times on my Rails 3.1 application when running on Ruby 1.9.2,
            I decided it was high time to upgrade to 1.9.3 to take advantage of its new hash-based require scheme. Turns out
            it was going to take an entire afternoon because of an issue with the <code>pg</code> gem's configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're having the same problem, try the following:
          </p>
          <pre>$ rvm use 1.9.3-p0
          $ gem uninstall pg # uninstall all versions
          $ gem install pg  --with-pg-config=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/bin/pg_config</pre>
          <p>
            Essentially, you need to be explicit about Homebrew's Postgres installation so you don't end up using
            the default Mac installation.

            My brother stumbled upon my last post,
            <a href="/2413224cf1c6f2206c3f7156419b68a54fc67acd/">We have the capacity for renaissance</a>,
            and suggested I read Seth Godin's book <em>Linchpin</em>.
            Only thirty-some-odd pages into it and I'm realizing he's preaching
            what I so-humbly prophetized five years ago: My generation's affluence
            depends not upon employment, following, or obedience, but upon
            self-reliance, leadership, and challenging the status quo. For the first time in
            our industrial society, Godin proclaims, the proletariat owns the means of production.

            In my last days of my undergraduate study, I held an internship at a small software
            company in Ithaca, New York. When I decided to up and move across the country to Portland,
            I was bold enough to inquire about telecommuting. They said yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What an exciting, new prospect! I had heard of transcriptionists and architects taking their work home with them,
            but the idea that I could work among a team of four engineers sitting in a seat
            3,000 miles and three timezones away seemed like a fantasy. This was in 2007 a time when VoIP was in its
            barely-useful infancy. Source control systems were hosted on dedicated servers and lacked the social facilities
            which make GitHub such a joy to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving to Portland, in retrospect, was like sailing the maiden voyage of a vessel to a new world.
            One free from the shackles of 9-5 work schedules, daily commutes, lacking office kitchen facilities,
            distracting water cooler jabber, and most importantly, <em>showing up for work</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents' generation was the Worker Bee Generation. Throughout my childhood,
            my parents preached higher education not as a means for academic enrichment, but
            as a means toward gainful employment. It's not their fault they were wrong to assume
            polite obedience and good grades would bear our generation's livings. It is our
            responsibility to adjust our attitudes and act in accordance with our brave new economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are thoughtworkers. Whereas a steel worker's hands are easily replaced by another's hands, the
            thoughtworker's mind is irreplaceable and irreplicable. Manual and clerical labor are mere <em>facilities</em>
            to assist creative people to realize their visions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are the new elite. We have the power to shift opinion, to automate businesses, to create and topple
            entire industries with our minds and some circuitry. And we're doing it from your neighborhood coffee shop,
            your cocktail bar, your park's picnic table, and the beach.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's so fucking cool.

            So frequently I find myself in awe over the tools available for content creation and
            distribution&dash;tools which might have cost the average worker's annual salary only a decade ago.
            The Internet has granted nearly everyone the capacity to realize and disseminate the ideas in their hearts and minds
            in a way we've never known in any culture, ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why then, do we trend toward consumption-centric use patterns with our new technology? I consider myself prolific,
            but I still find myself checking my Facebook and Twitter feeds constantly, as if this moment of my life is
            incomplete. We flock toward the mundane minutae of image macros and top ten lists despite their obvious irrelevance
            to profound betterment of our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each and every one of us has the capacity to create. What will you make today?
