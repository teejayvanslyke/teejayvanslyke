        <h2>Our automobile epidemic</h2>
        <div class="body"><p>
  Last night saw yet <a href="http://bikeportland.org/2012/05/16/collision-at-sw-3rd-and-madison-leaves-woman-with-life-threatening-injuries-71838">another bicyclist death</a>
  in Portland. And, as with most cyclist fatalities,
  Kathryn Rickson fell victim to a negligent motorist. Yet, somehow, the automobile remains the
  fabric of modern society. Despite its reputation as the leading cause of accidental death in the
  world, Americans are addicted to their cars. And it should be treated as much as an epidemic as
  smoking or obesity.
</p>
<p>
  I write all of this sitting in my three-ton RV, so you might call me a hypocrite. I love automobiles.
  They're great tools for traveling medium distances. But across America, automobiles are being
  misused as a means of transit for very short distances in densely-populated areas. Here in Portland,
  we advocate the bicycle as a healthy alternative to automobile transit. Yet our streets are still
  flooded with big, loud, noisy cars. Taking a walk usually involves having to be vigilant of two-ton
  aluminum boxes on wheels barreling down the street at 30 miles per hour. And this is normal?
</p>
<p>
  Historically, city streets served as much as community meeting places as they did for transport.
  Streets are unique in that they are publicly owned like parks, but adjacent to private residences
  and businesses. Before the automobile (and on the very few designated car-free streets in America),
  streets were vibrant centers of collaboration and community. Why have we voluntarily surrendered our
  centers of community to the automobile?
</p>
<p>
  We're so entrenched in car culture that the proposals I'm about to make will sound absurd. But, if
  enacted, I think we'd free our cities from the strangleholds of car traffic, noise and pollution in
  a profound way.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Make parking unaffordable to non-residents.</strong>
    In Portland, parking is generally abundant. With several downtown parking garages, generally free
    street parking, and friendly residential areas with tons of overflow spots, it's rare to think
    twice about driving because you won't have a place to park. If we enact a city tax on parking to
    the tune of $5/hour, you'll use public transit or a bicycle faster than you can say Hummer. Of course,
    residents should have parking permits for their neighborhoods excluding them from this tax. The
    point isn't to discourage car ownership--only to discourage traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduce the maximum speed to 15 MPH.</strong>
    Cars don't kill people. People with poor reaction time kill people. Currently, the City of Portland's
    default maximum speed limit is 25 MPH. While reasonable for car-only travel, cars traveling at this
    speed are still a nuissance to pedestrians crossing streets and bicyles attempting to maintain the
    flow of traffic among automobiles. Reducing the maximum speed would also discourage car use since
    bicycling would yield approximately the same trip duration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Remove parking lanes from business districts and replace with combination of bicycle corrals</strong>
    and sidewalks.
    All business districts in Portland, from Alberta St to Hawthorne Blvd to NW 23rd Ave, permit short-term street
    parking. Not only do cars parking on these streets cause a nuissance to other motorists and bicyclists
    passing through, but the line of cars littering curbs in these districts reduce the amount of livable
    community space open to businesses and citizens. By forcing patrons to park elsewhere, we would create
    peaceful, open-air pedestrian malls.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Require urban drivers to have a permit which must be renewed monthly.</strong>
    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think if enacted properly, could be the best measure against unnnecessary
    automobile traffic. Want to drive in Portland? You'll need to have a sticker on your car saying you've
    paid your fee this month. Commercial vehicles might have an exemption from this policy since freight traffic
    is a necessary evil on our streets. But if you own a passenger vehicle and want to use it to go to work,
    the grocery store, or wherever else, you'll pay the price.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now, I'm not an urban planner. I'm not sure of the unforeseen consequences of my recommendations. I'm merely
  starting the conversation about a post-automobile Portland. And, with enough support, I think we can make a dent
  in a problem more serious than any of us like to admit.
