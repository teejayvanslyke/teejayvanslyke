          <h3>Why I quit Facebook</h3>

  The other day, I authored a blog post entitled <em>Stop Driving Now</em>, which was effectively an
  angry rant fueled by the actions of aggressive motorists on my ride home that afternoon. Smugly,
  I posted it on Facebook, hoping it would attract attention. It did. I was ostracized (rightly) as
  an angry asshole. Comment after comment filled the link post until I finally decided to delete
  it. But another thing happened: I became consumed with the opinions of my peers. I had a hard time
  sleeping that night because I knew that my post had offended someone. And it was far from the
  first time this had happened.
</p>
<p>
  A few weeks earlier, I encountered a post by an acquaintance thinking of joining the Marines.
  Being in staunch opposition to joining the military as a career choice, I voiced my concern
  with hope that I might change her mind. After all, the opinion of a relative stranger
  couldn't hurt, could it?
</p>
<p>
  It could. An hour and 30 comments later, I had alienated myself from people I hadn't even
  met. Despite never having shared an experience to substantiate resistance, I created a
  situation which left everyone feeling exhausted and vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
  Social media is my generation's sitcoms. Replace Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer with four
  people you met at a bar a year ago, and you've effectively captured the level of triviality
  our Facebook feeds provide us. Even seemingly noble pursuits, whether the <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/06/03/anti-gay-group-slams-jcpenneys-over-fathers-day-ad/">JCPenney fathers day</a>
  ad or the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/angry-internet-lawyer-sues-the-oatmeal-bears-and-cancer-research/">Oatmeal fundraiser</a>,
  have no bearing on the life we lead outside of Facebook and are better digested outside a
  public forum.
</p>
<p>
  I've chosen to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole of real life goes.
  See you on the other side.
