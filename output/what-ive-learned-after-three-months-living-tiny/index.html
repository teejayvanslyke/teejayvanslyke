          <h1>What I've learned after three months living tiny</h1>

</p>
<p>
  It's been about three months since my girlfriend and I trekked to Beaverton by bus
  to pick up the RV that I now call home. Since then, I've gone on a wild two-week
  roadtrip in my own house, transformed a modest RV interior into a luxurious palace on
  wheels, and learned so much about how to make the most of 100 square feet.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>When you live in a tiny space, clutter's effects are amplified.</strong>
    When I lived in my loft apartment, weeks would go by without giving the place a
    good decluttering. Bottles and cans from parties weeks ago would remain on my giant
    countertop. If I ate popcorn the night before, you'd likely find the remnants in my
    giant bowl sitting on my coffee table. In the RV, most surfaces serve many purposes,
    so there <em>simply isn't room</em> for clutter. I do my dishes within a day
    <em>because I only have one plate.</em> Everything has its right place, and if it
    doesn't, its misplacement will reveal itself as soon as I try to drive my house
    away and need to find a place to stow it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>When resources are limited, you curb your usage subconsciously.</strong>
    My RV holds 20 gallons of fresh water and 19 gallons of waste, which is just enough
    to live one week comfortably before going to the dump station. Because of this
    inconvenience, I find myself turning off the faucet to conserve water more than I
    did in a brick-and-mortar home. It's amusing how barbaric and selfish we actually
    are when it comes to conservation, but I'll admit it took knowing my own supply
    is limited before I'd make a concerted effort in curbing my usage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>My life is generally richer and more experience-driven.</strong>
    When you live in 100 square feet, you're not occupied with the temptation to buy
    a new, swanky piece of furniture. Since I moved into the RV, I've found myself
    more eager to leave the house to explore, since I've stripped my house of frivolty
    and responsibility. No space for a couch means I'm less likely to vegetate during
    the daytime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>A small space is dirt cheap to maintain!</strong>
    When I lived in my loft apartment, I was paying $1239/mo in rent, between $20-$100
    in electricity per month (it had electric forced air heat), and varying amounts
    in water and sewer usage. In the RV, my monthly expenses are $100/mo for my parking
    spot, about $25/mo for electricity, about $10/mo for propane, and $40/mo for waste
    disposal. That puts my monthly base living expenses at $175!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>A small space is cozy.</strong>
    My RV is just a downright pleasant place to be. Most people assume because I have
    such a small space that I'm not comfortable. I think the opposite is true. My
    walls are closer together. Rather than the cold, vast cavern my loft often felt like,
    my RV feels like a small, warm cocoon.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Okay, so you're probably thinking there <em>must</em> be some serious drawbacks to tiny
  living. "Don't you wish you had more room once in awhile?" "Doesn't living in your car
  get old?" "Don't you wish you had a shower in your house?" Sometimes these thoughts
  enter my mind. But in all honesty, the feeling of self-sufficiency, resourcefulness,
  and ingenuity I derive from this lifestyle far outweigh the drawbacks. Quite frankly, I'm
  happier than I've ever been.
