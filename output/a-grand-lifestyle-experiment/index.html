        <h2>A grand lifestyle experiment</h2>
        <div class="body"><p>
  My friends are doing their best to support me. My girlfriend has been a guiding light through the process.
  My parents think I'm insane. Regardless of opinion, I'm now living in a 1995 Winnebago Rialta.
</p>
<h4>Fat and unable to move</h4>
<p>
  I was getting fat. Not around the waistline -- around my apartment. With two bicycles (down from four), three
  24"+ computer monitors, two computer workstations, numerous gadgets, a small studio's worth of music production
  gear, and a closet full of clothes I never wore, I was destined to live life reluctantly renewing leases for fear
  of moving on. <em>What would I do with all this stuff?</em> The idea terrified me. It terrified me so much that
  I'd have nightmares about never being able to leave Portland. You know, the ones where Sam Adams erects a wall
  around the city and David Hasselhof tries to save us. Or something.
</p>
<h4>Down by the river</h4>
<p>
  Rewind back to 2002. A simpler time. A time where a 17-year-old high school senior could make his daily allowance
  working for the local supermarket and dream about one day living in a van. <em>&quot;I could go anywhere, anytime!&quot;</em>,
  I'd think to myself. <em>&quot;I could even install a computer inside, and wardrive for fresh wi-fi hotspots around town!&quot;</em>.
</p>
<p>
  But alas, vans cost thousands of dollars, and I didn't have any credit... or thousands of dollars. Dreams crushed.
</p>
<h4>A fear of flight</h4>
<p>
  When I was in my early twenties, I'd fly everywhere without a thought. In 2008 I flew to and from Europe three
  times in the course of only a few weeks. I loved to fly. But then...
</p>
<p>
  Then this pesky part of my brain called my frontal lobe developed. All of the sudden flying was for the birds,
  stepping too close to the edge of cliffs was a death wish, and earthquakes were common in Portland, Oregon. And so
  ended my era of easy, fast transcontinental travel.
</p>
<p>
  Forever stranded 3,000 miles away from home, with an unnerving desire to see something different when I awaken in the morning,
  I decided it was time to fulfill my teenage pipe dream. And so far, I've never been more fulfilled by a decision in my life.
</p>
<h4>Criminally small</h4>
<p>
  Perusing the zoning ordinances for most urban areas, you'll find that the minimum square footage for a residence is somewhere in the
  vicinity of 400 square feet. You'll also find that (in Portland, at least) parking your motorhome on the street overnight is illegal.
  And then there's the city's camping laws, which prohibit camping in a private yard for longer than 14 consecutive days. In my opinion,
  these laws do more to disturb the peace than protect it.
</p>
<p>
  So, we'll see what happens. The worst that can come of this is I have to move my house, which, at this point, involves putting it in drive.
  I'm making it a point to be very respectful to my neighbors and yard-mates, so hopefully it won't be a problem for the short duration I
  plan to remain in Portland.
</p>
<h4>You say RV. I say land yacht.</h4>
<p>
  If you think I'm sacrificing comfort or style living in less than 100 square feet, think again. I've only had my RV for a week, and already
  I've installed a Bluetooth-ready car stereo, assembled a custom computer workstation made out of an IKEA kitchen table, a memory foam mattress,
  a magnetic spice rack with magnetic on-wall storage for metallic tools, an area rug, 4G wireless Internet access, and LED lighting. This makes
  my RV less a trashy mobile home and more a classy land yacht, ready for adventure and equipped for my live/work lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
  I cannot take credit for my inspiration in this endeavor, though. Most of the reassurance that "everything is going to be okay" comes from
  <a href="http://tynan.com">Tynan</a>, who wrote an excellent book about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tiniest-Mansion-Live-Luxury-ebook/dp/B006XLK2LW">living
  in a small RV</a>. And then there's <a href="http://livinginrv.com">Mikko Kemppe</a>, who coined the phrase <em>Urban Mobile Lifestyle</em> and lives in a
  Winnebago Era. He hasn't updated his site in awhile, so I'm curious what he's up to now.
</p>
<p>
  So there you have it. I'm not sure what's to come of my grand experiment, but I can tell you it'll be more exciting than sitting at home
  watching reruns of <em>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>. Not that I won't miss The Gang...
