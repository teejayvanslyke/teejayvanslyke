&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The general consensus is that Portland is a relatively safe and tolerant city. Most of the time, my beliefs,
  appearance, and behavior are tolerated and accepted by most people. Either that or they're passive-aggressively keeping
  their mouths shut. Either way, altercations rarely arise, and when they do, they're resolved swiftly
  and peacefully.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  On Sunday, May 27, 2012, at approximately 3:00 pm, my faith in those convictions was shattered as I looked
  the fender of a speeding red convertible in the eye, contemplating, if only for a fraction of a second, the possibility  that my life might be cut short by an unmeditated act of aggression.
  that my life might be cut short by an unmeditated act of aggression. I was (and still am) reluctant to make the details of this incident public for my own safety, but I cannot help
  but share a synopsis as a friendly reminder that such aggression can happen here, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As I approached an intersection by bicycle, two cars queued in the lane
  beside me, followed by a third. As soon as the signal turned green, I continued through.
  The motorist in the first car stopped in order to yield to my right of way before proceeding with her right turn. I
  continued approximately 200 feet, when I heard a loud bang from behind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The third car, a red convertible, had rear-ended the second car. Instead of pulling off the street to exchange
  insurance information, the red convertible proceeded to swerve out of the right lane into the left lane, pass both
  the other cars back into the right lane, and aggressively run me off the road, his front
  bumper well into the bicycle lane. Did he believe it to be my fault he rear-ended another car?
  Did he just not have an insurance policy? What perverse cowardice
  could drive someone to such aggression?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day, as I was walking down the sidewalk on my way to the grocery store, a teenager yelled &amp;quot;Faggot!&amp;quot;
  out the window of his SUV as he sped by. Boy, he sure must have felt empowered, him and his big SUV and his homophobic
  slurs. I wish that poor, deprived, wandering soul the best of luck, because despite his bigoted demeanor, my own
  self-love and improvement-oriented attitude mean I'll live a happier, healthier life than the lowlife aggressor. While
  he digs outward, I dig inward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Aggression is the outward reflection of a person's insecurities and fears. The aggressor sees something in his victim,
  whether it be social status, intellectual ability, self-confidence, or physical prowess, which he either lacks or believes
  he lacks. Instead of looking inward and asking how he can possess the qualities of his victim, he chooses to belittle
  his victim's weaknesses. So, the next time you're a victim of aggression or bullying, just remember that it just means
  your aggressor is probably wrought with insecurity and misery because your stride is just that much better than his.
  Just don't get run over in the process.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Help me park my house!</title>
    <published>2012-05-20T02:39:09Z</published>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/help-me-park-my-house/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src='/assets/images/help-me-park-my-house.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've decided that, based on location and other factors, I'd like to find another spot to park my
  tiny RV in Portland. Preferably, I'd like to be somewhere within the following boundaries:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;N:&lt;/strong&gt;
    South of Killingsworth St, east of Interstate Ave, north of Tillamook St.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;NE:&lt;/strong&gt;
    South of Killingsworth St, north of Tillamook St.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt;
    North of Powell Blvd, west of 12th Ave, east of Cesar Chavez Blvd
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  All I would ask is to use your electricity (via extension cord), to shower in your bathroom, and to use
  your laundry machines (if present). My RV is only 20'8", so it only takes up slightly more room than a
  standard parking spot. It's also downright adorable (pictured above).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Though what I'm envisioning is an arrangement as an auxiliary dwelling alongside an existing residence,
  I'd also be open to a spot in a parking lot, etc if I were close enough to a facility for bathing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Please spread the word! I'm willing to pay whatever the landowner or tenants think is fair. I'm quiet,
  considerate, and clean. Thank you for your support!
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">What I've learned after three months living tiny</title>
    <published>2012-05-19T17:25:09Z</published>

  &lt;img src='/assets/images/what-ive-learned-after-three-months-living-tiny.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's been about three months since my girlfriend and I trekked to Beaverton by bus
  to pick up the RV that I now call home. Since then, I've gone on a wild two-week
  roadtrip in my own house, transformed a modest RV interior into a luxurious palace on
  wheels, and learned so much about how to make the most of 100 square feet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;When you live in a tiny space, clutter's effects are amplified.&lt;/strong&gt;
    When I lived in my loft apartment, weeks would go by without giving the place a
    good decluttering. Bottles and cans from parties weeks ago would remain on my giant
    countertop. If I ate popcorn the night before, you'd likely find the remnants in my
    giant bowl sitting on my coffee table. In the RV, most surfaces serve many purposes,
    so there &lt;em&gt;simply isn't room&lt;/em&gt; for clutter. I do my dishes within a day
    &lt;em&gt;because I only have one plate.&lt;/em&gt; Everything has its right place, and if it
    doesn't, its misplacement will reveal itself as soon as I try to drive my house
    away and need to find a place to stow it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;When resources are limited, you curb your usage subconsciously.&lt;/strong&gt;
    My RV holds 20 gallons of fresh water and 19 gallons of waste, which is just enough
    to live one week comfortably before going to the dump station. Because of this
    inconvenience, I find myself turning off the faucet to conserve water more than I
    did in a brick-and-mortar home. It's amusing how barbaric and selfish we actually
    are when it comes to conservation, but I'll admit it took knowing my own supply
    is limited before I'd make a concerted effort in curbing my usage.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;My life is generally richer and more experience-driven.&lt;/strong&gt;
    When you live in 100 square feet, you're not occupied with the temptation to buy
    a new, swanky piece of furniture. Since I moved into the RV, I've found myself
    more eager to leave the house to explore, since I've stripped my house of frivolty
    and responsibility. No space for a couch means I'm less likely to vegetate during
    the daytime.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A small space is dirt cheap to maintain!&lt;/strong&gt;
    When I lived in my loft apartment, I was paying $1239/mo in rent, between $20-$100
    in electricity per month (it had electric forced air heat), and varying amounts
    in water and sewer usage. In the RV, my monthly expenses are $100/mo for my parking
    spot, about $25/mo for electricity, about $10/mo for propane, and $40/mo for waste
    disposal. That puts my monthly base living expenses at $175!
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A small space is cozy.&lt;/strong&gt;
    My RV is just a downright pleasant place to be. Most people assume because I have
    such a small space that I'm not comfortable. I think the opposite is true. My
    walls are closer together. Rather than the cold, vast cavern my loft often felt like,
    my RV feels like a small, warm cocoon.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Okay, so you're probably thinking there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be some serious drawbacks to tiny
  living. "Don't you wish you had more room once in awhile?" "Doesn't living in your car
  get old?" "Don't you wish you had a shower in your house?" Sometimes these thoughts
  enter my mind. But in all honesty, the feeling of self-sufficiency, resourcefulness,
  and ingenuity I derive from this lifestyle far outweigh the drawbacks. Quite frankly, I'm
  happier than I've ever been.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Our automobile epidemic</title>
    <published>2012-05-17T19:40:09Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-17T19:40:09Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/our-automobile-epidemic/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Last night saw yet &lt;a href="http://bikeportland.org/2012/05/16/collision-at-sw-3rd-and-madison-leaves-woman-with-life-threatening-injuries-71838"&gt;another bicyclist death&lt;/a&gt;
  in Portland. And, as with most cyclist fatalities,
  Kathryn Rickson fell victim to a negligent motorist. Yet, somehow, the automobile remains the
  fabric of modern society. Despite its reputation as the leading cause of accidental death in the
  world, Americans are addicted to their cars. And it should be treated as much as an epidemic as
  smoking or obesity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I write all of this sitting in my three-ton RV, so you might call me a hypocrite. I love automobiles.
  They're great tools for traveling medium distances. But across America, automobiles are being
  misused as a means of transit for very short distances in densely-populated areas. Here in Portland,
  we advocate the bicycle as a healthy alternative to automobile transit. Yet our streets are still
  flooded with big, loud, noisy cars. Taking a walk usually involves having to be vigilant of two-ton
  aluminum boxes on wheels barreling down the street at 30 miles per hour. And this is normal?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Historically, city streets served as much as community meeting places as they did for transport.
  Streets are unique in that they are publicly owned like parks, but adjacent to private residences
  and businesses. Before the automobile (and on the very few designated car-free streets in America),
  streets were vibrant centers of collaboration and community. Why have we voluntarily surrendered our
  centers of community to the automobile?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We're so entrenched in car culture that the proposals I'm about to make will sound absurd. But, if
  enacted, I think we'd free our cities from the strangleholds of car traffic, noise and pollution in
  a profound way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Make parking unaffordable to non-residents.&lt;/strong&gt;
    In Portland, parking is generally abundant. With several downtown parking garages, generally free
    street parking, and friendly residential areas with tons of overflow spots, it's rare to think
    twice about driving because you won't have a place to park. If we enact a city tax on parking to
    the tune of $5/hour, you'll use public transit or a bicycle faster than you can say Hummer. Of course,
    residents should have parking permits for their neighborhoods excluding them from this tax. The
    point isn't to discourage car ownership--only to discourage traffic.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Reduce the maximum speed to 15 MPH.&lt;/strong&gt;
    Cars don't kill people. People with poor reaction time kill people. Currently, the City of Portland's
    default maximum speed limit is 25 MPH. While reasonable for car-only travel, cars traveling at this
    speed are still a nuissance to pedestrians crossing streets and bicyles attempting to maintain the
    flow of traffic among automobiles. Reducing the maximum speed would also discourage car use since
    bicycling would yield approximately the same trip duration.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Remove parking lanes from business districts and replace with combination of bicycle corrals&lt;/strong&gt;
    and sidewalks.
    All business districts in Portland, from Alberta St to Hawthorne Blvd to NW 23rd Ave, permit short-term street
    parking. Not only do cars parking on these streets cause a nuissance to other motorists and bicyclists
    passing through, but the line of cars littering curbs in these districts reduce the amount of livable
    community space open to businesses and citizens. By forcing patrons to park elsewhere, we would create
    peaceful, open-air pedestrian malls.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Require urban drivers to have a permit which must be renewed monthly.&lt;/strong&gt;
    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think if enacted properly, could be the best measure against unnnecessary
    automobile traffic. Want to drive in Portland? You'll need to have a sticker on your car saying you've
    paid your fee this month. Commercial vehicles might have an exemption from this policy since freight traffic
    is a necessary evil on our streets. But if you own a passenger vehicle and want to use it to go to work,
    the grocery store, or wherever else, you'll pay the price.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, I'm not an urban planner. I'm not sure of the unforeseen consequences of my recommendations. I'm merely
  starting the conversation about a post-automobile Portland. And, with enough support, I think we can make a dent
  in a problem more serious than any of us like to admit.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Using HTML data attributes to elegantly create Mixpanel trackers</title>
    <published>2012-05-01T17:16:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-01T17:16:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/using-data-attributes-to-elegantly-create-mixpanel-trackers/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been using &lt;a href="http://mixpanel.com"&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt; to track user behavior on one of my projects, and sought a more elegant way to track link clicks than the &lt;code&gt;track_links&lt;/code&gt;
  method the standard API provides. Instead, I'd like to be able to specify the tracker's name and properties as HTML attributes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Simply paste this snippet into your document ready block to get started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/2569284.js?file=gistfile1.coffee"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then, on any links you'd like to track, simply provide the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-tracker&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Specify custom properties in JSON using the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-properties&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-properties=&amp;quot;{agency: 'nasa', mission: 'apollo 13'}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This snippet will automatically redirect the user to the link's &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; after 300ms, so no
  need to worry if the Mixpanel request failed. Happy tracking!
&lt;/p&gt;
