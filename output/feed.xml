  My brother stumbled upon my last post,
  &lt;a href="/2413224cf1c6f2206c3f7156419b68a54fc67acd/"&gt;We have the capacity for renaissance&lt;/a&gt;,
  and suggested I read Seth Godin's book &lt;em&gt;Linchpin&lt;/em&gt;.
  Only thirty-some-odd pages into it and I'm realizing he's preaching
  what I so-humbly prophetized five years ago: My generation's affluence
  depends not upon employment, following, or obedience, but upon
  self-reliance, leadership, and challenging the status quo. For the first time in
  our industrial society, Godin proclaims, the proletariat owns the means of production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In my last days of my undergraduate study, I held an internship at a small software
  company in Ithaca, New York. When I decided to up and move across the country to Portland,
  I was bold enough to inquire about telecommuting. They said yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What an exciting, new prospect! I had heard of transcriptionists and architects taking their work home with them,
  but the idea that I could work among a team of four engineers sitting in a seat
  3,000 miles and three timezones away seemed like a fantasy. This was in 2007 a time when VoIP was in its
  barely-useful infancy. Source control systems were hosted on dedicated servers and lacked the social facilities
  which make GitHub such a joy to use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Moving to Portland, in retrospect, was like sailing the maiden voyage of a vessel to a new world.
  One free from the shackles of 9-5 work schedules, daily commutes, lacking office kitchen facilities,
  distracting water cooler jabber, and most importantly, &lt;em&gt;showing up for work&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My parents' generation was the Worker Bee Generation. Throughout my childhood,
  my parents preached higher education not as a means for academic enrichment, but
  as a means toward gainful employment. It's not their fault they were wrong to assume
  polite obedience and good grades would bear our generation's livings. It is our
  responsibility to adjust our attitudes and act in accordance with our brave new economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We are thoughtworkers. Whereas a steel worker's hands are easily replaced by another's hands, the
  thoughtworker's mind is irreplaceable and irreplicable. Manual and clerical labor are mere &lt;em&gt;facilities&lt;/em&gt;
  to assist creative people to realize their visions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We are the new elite. We have the power to shift opinion, to automate businesses, to create and topple
  entire industries with our minds and some circuitry. And we're doing it from your neighborhood coffee shop,
  your cocktail bar, your park's picnic table, and the beach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  That's so fucking cool.
&lt;/p&gt;

  So frequently I find myself in awe over the tools available for content creation and
  distribution&amp;dash;tools which might have cost the average worker's annual salary only a decade ago.
  The Internet has granted nearly everyone the capacity to realize and disseminate the ideas in their hearts and minds
  in a way we've never known in any culture, ever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Why then, do we trend toward consumption-centric use patterns with our new technology? I consider myself prolific,
  but I still find myself checking my Facebook and Twitter feeds constantly, as if this moment of my life is
  incomplete. We flock toward the mundane minutae of image macros and top ten lists despite their obvious irrelevance
  to profound betterment of our lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Each and every one of us has the capacity to create. What will you make today?
&lt;/p&gt;
