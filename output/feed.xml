  &lt;img alt='You take the blue pill -- the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill -- you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.' src='/assets/images/why-i-quit-facebook-morpheus.jpeg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The other day, I authored a blog post entitled &lt;em&gt;Stop Driving Now&lt;/em&gt;, which was effectively an
  angry rant fueled by the actions of aggressive motorists on my ride home that afternoon. Smugly,
  I posted it on Facebook, hoping it would attract attention. It did. I was ostracized (rightly) as
  an angry asshole. Comment after comment filled the link post until I finally decided to delete
  it. But another thing happened: I became consumed with the opinions of my peers. I had a hard time
  sleeping that night because I knew that my post had offended someone. And it was far from the
  first time this had happened.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  A few weeks earlier, I encountered a post by an acquaintance thinking of joining the Marines.
  Being in staunch opposition to joining the military as a career choice, I voiced my concern
  with hope that I might change her mind. After all, the opinion of a relative stranger
  couldn't hurt, could it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It could. An hour and 30 comments later, I had alienated myself from people I hadn't even
  met. Despite never having shared an experience to substantiate resistance, I created a
  situation which left everyone feeling exhausted and vulnerable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Social media is my generation's sitcoms. Replace Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer with four
  people you met at a bar a year ago, and you've effectively captured the level of triviality
  our Facebook feeds provide us. Even seemingly noble pursuits, whether the &lt;a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/06/03/anti-gay-group-slams-jcpenneys-over-fathers-day-ad/"&gt;JCPenney fathers day&lt;/a&gt;
  ad or the &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/angry-internet-lawyer-sues-the-oatmeal-bears-and-cancer-research/"&gt;Oatmeal fundraiser&lt;/a&gt;,
  have no bearing on the life we lead outside of Facebook and are better digested outside a
  public forum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've chosen to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole of real life goes.
  See you on the other side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    If you're ready to take the plunge and delete your Facebook account permanently, visit
    this page in the Facebook Help Center:

      How do I permanently delete my account?

&lt;p&gt;
  I'm proud to announce that, after months of being unavailable for high-quality MP3 download, Elias Moniker's
  debut album 'The A.K.A.' is once again available at the reduced sale price of $4.99!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For those of you unaware, I produced &lt;em&gt;The A.K.A.&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. It's a sinister, dubstep-influenced record and
  I put my heart and soul into it. Since then I've been on a bit of a musical
  hiatus with all my other projects, but I'd love to get the album into as many ears as I can.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Disable volume buttons on iOS using Activator</title>
    <published>2012-06-13T03:33:53Z</published>
    <updated>2012-06-13T03:33:53Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/disable-volume-buttons-on-ios-using-activator/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  The other night, I stumbled while holding my iPad and knocked my volume-up button such that it now sticks, meaning the
  volume indicator is now stuck on-screen. Luckily, I devised a way to disable both volume buttons using the Cydia-based app
  Activator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To enable this hack, you'll need a jailbroken iOS device, the latest version of Cydia, and to have the Activator app installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inside Activator, tap 'Anywhere'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll to the bottom of the list to 'Volume Buttons'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap each item in the 'Volume Buttons' section and select 'Do Nothing'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Your volume indicator should disappear and you just saved yourself a trip to the Apple Store, or worse, the cost of a new
  iPad.
&lt;/p&gt;
