&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's becoming easier and faster than ever to bring an idea to market. Unfortunately,
  too many could-be entrepreneurs are busy crafting ideas that are everything to everyone
  instead of something to someone. And, in the fervor of implementation, we become overwhelmed
  and give up altogether. Sound familiar?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This week, I launched two new products. Yes, you read that right. I &lt;em&gt;launched&lt;/em&gt; two
  products, and they're available for purchase &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. Both conceived, implemented, and
  marketed in less than a week. Are they fully-featured? No, not really. Will they provide
  value? Yes, in fact, I'm already using both myself. A product providing value already
  in the marketplace is worth so much more than a so-called "fully featured" product years
  into development that still has yet to find a customer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There are a few criteria which separate 24-hour startups from their behemoth never-launched
  cousins:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Build a product you would buy yourself, and sell it at a price you'd pay.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I cannot stress this enough. If you're your own customer, you've just eliminated months
      of market research and collaboration prior to bringing the product to market. And, if
      you're willing to pay money for something you've built, you're more likely to execute
      effectively and others are more likely to click 'Purchase'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Build the minimum saleable version &amp;dash; No more.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Build a product that does one thing really, really well. A laundry list of features
      is no good if all of them are implemented poorly. Build the smallest saleable component
      of your product now, and take it to market immediately. Your customers will lead the way
      for the rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Build a product which, if no units are sold, can be leveraged for other products.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When I built my &lt;a href="http://panacheicons.com"&gt;Panache!&lt;/a&gt; icon set product, I knew
      the likelyhood of becoming filthy stinking rich from icons was nil. But I was tired of
      using the same old icons and glyphs for my projects and wanted to give my work a unique
      flare. So, I outsourced their production to an &lt;a href="http://elance.com"&gt;Elance&lt;/a&gt;
      freelance designer and watched as my icons poured into my inbox. As soon as I made them
      available for sale, I immediately started in on &lt;a href="http://moolarb.com"&gt;Moola&lt;/a&gt;
      and leveraged the same icons on its marketing page.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Build a product that requires minimal support and infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Software-as-a-service requires recurring billing infrastructure which sometimes takes
      as long to implement and test as the core product itself. Digital products, on the other
      hand, can be distributed using a one-off pricing model with no need for tracking
      account payments, upgrades, or cancellations. This allows you to start charging credit
      cards sooner rather than later.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope my success building microproducts will inspire you to craft your own. If you're
  looking for a quick way to bootstrap your new microenterprise, check out
  &lt;a href="http://moolarb.com"&gt;Moola&lt;/a&gt;, my Ruby web framework for accepting credit card
  payments in just ten lines of code. It includes a Getting Started guide with instructions
  for taking payments using &lt;a href="http://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; and deploying on
  &lt;a href="http://heroku.com"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. Good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img alt='You take the blue pill -- the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill -- you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.' src='/assets/images/why-i-quit-facebook-morpheus.jpeg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The other day, I authored a blog post entitled &lt;em&gt;Stop Driving Now&lt;/em&gt;, which was effectively an
  angry rant fueled by the actions of aggressive motorists on my ride home that afternoon. Smugly,
  I posted it on Facebook, hoping it would attract attention. It did. I was ostracized (rightly) as
  an angry asshole. Comment after comment filled the link post until I finally decided to delete
  it. But another thing happened: I became consumed with the opinions of my peers. I had a hard time
  sleeping that night because I knew that my post had offended someone. And it was far from the
  first time this had happened.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  A few weeks earlier, I encountered a post by an acquaintance thinking of joining the Marines.
  Being in staunch opposition to joining the military as a career choice, I voiced my concern
  with hope that I might change her mind. After all, the opinion of a relative stranger
  couldn't hurt, could it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It could. An hour and 30 comments later, I had alienated myself from people I hadn't even
  met. Despite never having shared an experience to substantiate resistance, I created a
  situation which left everyone feeling exhausted and vulnerable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Social media is my generation's sitcoms. Replace Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer with four
  people you met at a bar a year ago, and you've effectively captured the level of triviality
  our Facebook feeds provide us. Even seemingly noble pursuits, whether the &lt;a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/06/03/anti-gay-group-slams-jcpenneys-over-fathers-day-ad/"&gt;JCPenney fathers day&lt;/a&gt;
  ad or the &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/angry-internet-lawyer-sues-the-oatmeal-bears-and-cancer-research/"&gt;Oatmeal fundraiser&lt;/a&gt;,
  have no bearing on the life we lead outside of Facebook and are better digested outside a
  public forum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've chosen to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole of real life goes.
  See you on the other side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    If you're ready to take the plunge and delete your Facebook account permanently, visit
    this page in the Facebook Help Center:
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CFwQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F%3Ffaq%3D224562897555674&amp;amp;ei=W6_kT5OfMIPQ2wWM4sHaCQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHnmOXrbJ_X6UQlwBxhJF_pqcJWcA&amp;amp;sig2=uj7vFV9q2_5TE6QTw8H9vA'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I'm proud to announce that, after months of being unavailable for high-quality MP3 download, Elias Moniker's
  debut album 'The A.K.A.' is once again available at the reduced sale price of $4.99!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For those of you unaware, I produced &lt;em&gt;The A.K.A.&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. It's a sinister, dubstep-influenced record and
  I put my heart and soul into it. Since then I've been on a bit of a musical
  hiatus with all my other projects, but I'd love to get the album into as many ears as I can.
&lt;/p&gt;
