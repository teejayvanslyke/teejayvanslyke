    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Last night saw yet &lt;a href="http://bikeportland.org/2012/05/16/collision-at-sw-3rd-and-madison-leaves-woman-with-life-threatening-injuries-71838"&gt;another bicyclist death&lt;/a&gt;
  in Portland. And, as with most cyclist fatalities,
  Kathryn Rickson fell victim to a negligent motorist. Yet, somehow, the automobile remains the
  fabric of modern society. Despite its reputation as the leading cause of accidental death in the
  world, Americans are addicted to their cars. And it should be treated as much as an epidemic as
  smoking or obesity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I write all of this sitting in my three-ton RV, so you might call me a hypocrite. I love automobiles.
  They're great tools for traveling medium distances. But across America, automobiles are being
  misused as a means of transit for very short distances in densely-populated areas. Here in Portland,
  we advocate the bicycle as a healthy alternative to automobile transit. Yet our streets are still
  flooded with big, loud, noisy cars. Taking a walk usually involves having to be vigilant of two-ton
  aluminum boxes on wheels barreling down the street at 30 miles per hour. And this is normal?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Historically, city streets served as much as community meeting places as they did for transport.
  Streets are unique in that they are publicly owned like parks, but adjacent to private residences
  and businesses. Before the automobile (and on the very few designated car-free streets in America),
  streets were vibrant centers of collaboration and community. Why have we voluntarily surrendered our
  centers of community to the automobile?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We're so entrenched in car culture that the proposals I'm about to make will sound absurd. But, if
  enacted, I think we'd free our cities from the strangleholds of car traffic, noise and pollution in
  a profound way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Make parking unaffordable to non-residents.&lt;/strong&gt;
    In Portland, parking is generally abundant. With several downtown parking garages, generally free
    street parking, and friendly residential areas with tons of overflow spots, it's rare to think
    twice about driving because you won't have a place to park. If we enact a city tax on parking to
    the tune of $5/hour, you'll use public transit or a bicycle faster than you can say Hummer. Of course,
    residents should have parking permits for their neighborhoods excluding them from this tax. The
    point isn't to discourage car ownership--only to discourage traffic.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Reduce the maximum speed to 15 MPH.&lt;/strong&gt;
    Cars don't kill people. People with poor reaction time kill people. Currently, the City of Portland's
    default maximum speed limit is 25 MPH. While reasonable for car-only travel, cars traveling at this
    speed are still a nuissance to pedestrians crossing streets and bicyles attempting to maintain the
    flow of traffic among automobiles. Reducing the maximum speed would also discourage car use since
    bicycling would yield approximately the same trip duration.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Remove parking lanes from business districts and replace with combination of bicycle corrals&lt;/strong&gt;
    and sidewalks.
    All business districts in Portland, from Alberta St to Hawthorne Blvd to NW 23rd Ave, permit short-term street
    parking. Not only do cars parking on these streets cause a nuissance to other motorists and bicyclists
    passing through, but the line of cars littering curbs in these districts reduce the amount of livable
    community space open to businesses and citizens. By forcing patrons to park elsewhere, we would create
    peaceful, open-air pedestrian malls.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Require urban drivers to have a permit which must be renewed monthly.&lt;/strong&gt;
    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think if enacted properly, could be the best measure against unnnecessary
    automobile traffic. Want to drive in Portland? You'll need to have a sticker on your car saying you've
    paid your fee this month. Commercial vehicles might have an exemption from this policy since freight traffic
    is a necessary evil on our streets. But if you own a passenger vehicle and want to use it to go to work,
    the grocery store, or wherever else, you'll pay the price.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, I'm not an urban planner. I'm not sure of the unforeseen consequences of my recommendations. I'm merely
  starting the conversation about a post-automobile Portland. And, with enough support, I think we can make a dent
  in a problem more serious than any of us like to admit.

    <title type="html">Using HTML data attributes to elegantly create Mixpanel trackers</title>
    <published>2012-05-01T17:16:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-01T17:16:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/using-data-attributes-to-elegantly-create-mixpanel-trackers/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been using &lt;a href="http://mixpanel.com"&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt; to track user behavior on one of my projects, and sought a more elegant way to track link clicks than the &lt;code&gt;track_links&lt;/code&gt;
  method the standard API provides. Instead, I'd like to be able to specify the tracker's name and properties as HTML attributes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Simply paste this snippet into your document ready block to get started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/2569284.js?file=gistfile1.coffee"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then, on any links you'd like to track, simply provide the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-tracker&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Specify custom properties in JSON using the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-properties&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-properties=&amp;quot;{agency: 'nasa', mission: 'apollo 13'}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This snippet will automatically redirect the user to the link's &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; after 300ms, so no
  need to worry if the Mixpanel request failed. Happy tracking!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  March was a turbulent month for my body and mind. I had just terminated the lease on my
  apartment in Portland and was in the process of moving into a tiny RV. Every day was rendered
  more burdensome by persistent rain, gloomy skies, and an unnerving sense that the rabbit hole
  of my anguish would burrow ever-deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I set out on the open road in a blaze of escapist glory, thinking I was destined
  to find happiness outside myself. At first, the distraction of the road combined with the
  glimmer of sunshine provided me with the fulfillment I so craved. But, as with all stints of
  pleasure, it was short-lived and transient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I returned to Portland, I sought to properly investigate the source of my anguish.
  Why did I find myself in a constant state of yearning and escapism? It wasn't my friends, nor
  my surroundings, nor the weather, nor my work. I had tailored each of those to my liking--moreso
  than for most people have the opportunity or will. If none of those things, then &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=00438A&amp;t=tjva-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;asins=B0053ZHZI2" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Fast-forward to this weekend. Within a 24-hour span, I discovered a film and a book, the likes of
  which would change my life. The film is the recently released, critically-acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/em&gt;.
  In it, the documentarian examines &lt;em&gt;The China Study&lt;/em&gt;, the famed 2004 book examining the relationship between
  the consumption of animal products and illness, in the context of the Western diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was well-aware my diet wasn't optimal, but I knew my attentiveness toward what I put in my gullet was more than
  most Americans, so I thought little of it. But when I realized that certain foods, in adequate daily quantities, could
  reverse diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and coronary artery disease, I was astonished and sought to completely
  revamp my diet to meet and exceed those criteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/em&gt; evangelizes a strict vegan diet and claims meat, dairy, and even fish are not necessary for, and
  often detrimental to, a healthy, disease-preventitive diet. Being a curious little bugger, I never let one driver steer me
  down the street. After all, veganism is generally regarded as a veritable tightrope walk to get adequate levels of B vitamins,
  and essential amino acids. Dr. Terry Wahls, a now-recovering multiple sclerosis patient, gave a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/KLjgBLwH3Wc"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; detailing the diet
  she used to kickstart her brain and find her way out of a wheelchair and walking again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, rather than eating out for two or more meals per day, I go to the grocery store shortly after waking up each morning,
  buy a bunch of dark leafy greens, one colored vegetable, one bunch of herbs, two pieces of fruit, and a bag of seeds or
  nuts of my choosing. All of this becomes the basis for two heaping servings of raw salad. You probably think I'm malnourished,
  but I've never felt so alert and alive. My craving for &amp;quot;mood enhancers&amp;quot; like caffeine, alcohol and cannabis have
  diminished substantially, almost to the point where I find their use to yield a net negative effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I've got my body on the path to proper nourishment. On to my spirit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=tjva-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1577314808&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=00438A&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Enter &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; by Eckart Tolle. Typically I don't gravitate toward mainstream
  bestsellers as the source for great inspiration, but there are always exceptions. This is a big one. Tolle
  has re-taught me the duality of being and self, a distinction I hadn't forgotten but one I had certainly
  neglected in my daily life. Whenever I find myself becoming anxious, fearful, or stressed, I focus my
  attention to the beauty of the moment I'm living. After all, the past and future only exist as recollections
  and projections in our minds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This led to another realization, the likes of which Tolle couldn't have discussed in his 1999 book but stares
  me straight in the face in our twenty-first century age. If past and future are mere products of ego, if self and identity
  are ailments of our own making, then what does social media represent in that context? The ultimate manifestation
  of our egos in digital form? Are all the texts, tweets, status updates, and constant social noise causing us
  anxiety of which we're hardly aware? Does the comment I receive on my Facebook post, pushed straight to my phone
  and ready for my consumption the instant it is published, the most iconic example of &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-presence,
  &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-attentiveness, and unconscious living imaginable?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Eat your fucking vegetables and be here now.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been living out of my tiny RV for two months. My comfort level with the
  arrangement is growing steadily, to the point where I almost always get a good
  night's sleep in my vehicle. But there's still a nagging uncertainty amidst my
  gratification that I'll be caught and prosecuted for my behavior, the likes of
  which bears no harm upon others and has &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; of an environmental impact
  than a normal, modern living arrangement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I was in San Luis Obispo, I decided that its downtown core was much too alluring
  to spend my time driving between it and a campground on the outskirts of town. And so,
  despite its illegality, I spent the night in my RV parked on the street beside a
  law firm. I made sure my presence wouldn't upset anyone and kept my profile low. I
  awoke peacefully and didn't have any issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning over coffee, I executed a quick web search for &amp;quot;RV parking
  in San Luis Obispo&amp;quot; and came across &lt;a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/04/10/2023709/lawsuit-san-luis-obispo-homeless.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
  Turns out, SLO has enacted an ordinance banning RV camping from their streets in
  an effort to combat vagrantism and the drugs and violence that come with it. Yet
  another instance of combating a problem by enacting more laws, rather than approaching
  it with discretion and common sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I had three options. I could continue to spend my nights on city streets
  and risk being harassed by the police, I could find a campground on the outskirts of
  SLO and pay $45/night for 100 square feet of cement in an area with no amenities or
  attractions, or I could realize how unwelcome I felt and head home. I headed home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here in Portland, we're constantly at odds with how to deal with homelessness and
  vagrantism. Our downtown core is littered with their trash and our shelters have
  lines longer than swanky brunch cafes on a late Sunday morning. And yet, we continue
  to uphold laws prohibiting camping on public grounds and ordinances prohibiting
  long-term camping on private lots. In my short experience as a vagabond, my most striking
  observation was that my ability to be productive was drastically reduced when
  faced with the question of where I would sleep that night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now that I'm back in Portland and sitting pretty in my girlfriend's driveway while contributing
  my share of rent each month, I'm reminded that I'm still living an illegal lifestyle.
  Because of zoning ordinances in our city and most others, I've effectively erected a
  second domicile in a lot zoned for single-family occupancy, which if used regularly,
  constitutes a zoning violation. Luckily, I've got a laundry list of alibis if the city
  asks any questions. &amp;quot;This is my mobile office and I live in the house with my
  girlfriend&amp;quot; is what I'm sticking with for now. But the fact that I even have to
  &lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; having an alibi for completely harmless behavior (and in a time of
  increasing rent fees, one solution to the affordable housing problem) makes me cringe.
  Why should it be illegal for me to occupy a perfectly suitable dwelling on private property?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My RV lifestyle has granted me new perspective on homelessness and vagrantism.
  Despite my affluence and ability to get a hotel room or rent a house at a moment's notice,
  my reluctance to do those things means I face many of the same problems and vulnerabilities.
  I seek to live a happy, peaceful existence and have chosen minimalism as my path. It's too
  bad it's illegal for me to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;
