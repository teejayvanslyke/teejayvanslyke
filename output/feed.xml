  I have fond memories of dreaming away during my teenage youth at the prospect of one day finding a way
  to make a living on the road. Of one day building my ideal vessel: A veritable hacker's paradise on wheels.
  And yet, somehow I've always found a way to excuse myself from the dream's pursuit and realization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Well not this year, damnit. That's right. In Summer 2012, I set sail on the open road in a yet-to-be-converted
  Sprinter van, equipped with most of the amenities of home and bearing one overwhelmingly novel feature no
  condo or apartment ever could: A V6 engine and a set of wheels.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">RVM, Ruby 1.9.3, Homebrew and PostgreSQL make me want to kill babies</title>

  After much frustration with absymal load times on my Rails 3.1 application when running on Ruby 1.9.2,
  I decided it was high time to upgrade to 1.9.3 to take advantage of its new hash-based require scheme. Turns out
  it was going to take an entire afternoon because of an issue with the &lt;code&gt;pg&lt;/code&gt; gem's configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you're having the same problem, try the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ rvm use 1.9.3-p0
$ gem uninstall pg # uninstall all versions
$ gem install pg  --with-pg-config=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/bin/pg_config&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Essentially, you need to be explicit about Homebrew's Postgres installation so you don't end up using
  the default Mac installation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">My inner monologue</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  So I've noticed some things about my inner monologue when reading poorly-written prose:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;If someone misuses the word 'to' in place of 'too', my internal meter speeds up to accommodate the missing 'o'.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;What's up? Oh not to much.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Whenever someone writes in all capital letters, I shout the entire sentence to myself&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;HEY TEEJAY HOW'S IT GOING? I'M GOOD LOVE AUNT SHERRY&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;When someone uses the possessive pronoun "your" in place of the contraction "you're," I want to give my eyeballs paper cuts with acid blotter paper.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Boy I bet your glad I took that English class!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;And finally, when someone does all three at once, I write blog posts like this one!&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;YOUR REALLY GREAT AND WE SHOULD HANG OUT TO!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  My brother stumbled upon my last post,
  &lt;a href="/2413224cf1c6f2206c3f7156419b68a54fc67acd/"&gt;We have the capacity for renaissance&lt;/a&gt;,
  and suggested I read Seth Godin's book &lt;em&gt;Linchpin&lt;/em&gt;.
  Only thirty-some-odd pages into it and I'm realizing he's preaching
  what I so-humbly prophetized five years ago: My generation's affluence
  depends not upon employment, following, or obedience, but upon
  self-reliance, leadership, and challenging the status quo. For the first time in
  our industrial society, Godin proclaims, the proletariat owns the means of production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In my last days of my undergraduate study, I held an internship at a small software
  company in Ithaca, New York. When I decided to up and move across the country to Portland,
  I was bold enough to inquire about telecommuting. They said yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What an exciting, new prospect! I had heard of transcriptionists and architects taking their work home with them,
  but the idea that I could work among a team of four engineers sitting in a seat
  3,000 miles and three timezones away seemed like a fantasy. This was in 2007 a time when VoIP was in its
  barely-useful infancy. Source control systems were hosted on dedicated servers and lacked the social facilities
  which make GitHub such a joy to use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Moving to Portland, in retrospect, was like sailing the maiden voyage of a vessel to a new world.
  One free from the shackles of 9-5 work schedules, daily commutes, lacking office kitchen facilities,
  distracting water cooler jabber, and most importantly, &lt;em&gt;showing up for work&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My parents' generation was the Worker Bee Generation. Throughout my childhood,
  my parents preached higher education not as a means for academic enrichment, but
  as a means toward gainful employment. It's not their fault they were wrong to assume
  polite obedience and good grades would bear our generation's livings. It is our
  responsibility to adjust our attitudes and act in accordance with our brave new economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We are thoughtworkers. Whereas a steel worker's hands are easily replaced by another's hands, the
  thoughtworker's mind is irreplaceable and irreplicable. Manual and clerical labor are mere &lt;em&gt;facilities&lt;/em&gt;
  to assist creative people to realize their visions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We are the new elite. We have the power to shift opinion, to automate businesses, to create and topple
  entire industries with our minds and some circuitry. And we're doing it from your neighborhood coffee shop,
  your cocktail bar, your park's picnic table, and the beach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  That's so fucking cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
