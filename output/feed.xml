  The other night, I stumbled while holding my iPad and knocked my volume-up button such that it now sticks, meaning the
  volume indicator is now stuck on-screen. Luckily, I devised a way to disable both volume buttons using the Cydia-based app
  Activator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To enable this hack, you'll need a jailbroken iOS device, the latest version of Cydia, and to have the Activator app installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inside Activator, tap 'Anywhere'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll to the bottom of the list to 'Volume Buttons'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap each item in the 'Volume Buttons' section and select 'Do Nothing'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Your volume indicator should disappear and you just saved yourself a trip to the Apple Store, or worse, the cost of a new
  iPad.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The general consensus is that Portland is a relatively safe and tolerant city. Most of the time, my beliefs,
  appearance, and behavior are tolerated and accepted by most people. Either that or they're passive-aggressively keeping
  their mouths shut. Either way, altercations rarely arise, and when they do, they're resolved swiftly
  and peacefully.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  On Sunday, May 27, 2012, at approximately 3:00 pm, my faith in those convictions was shattered as I looked
  the fender of a speeding red convertible in the eye, contemplating, if only for a fraction of a second, the possibility
  that my life might be cut short by an unmeditated act of aggression. I was (and still am) reluctant to make the details of this incident public for my own safety, but I cannot help
  but share a synopsis as a friendly reminder that such aggression can happen here, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As I approached an intersection by bicycle, two cars queued in the lane
  beside me, followed by a third. As soon as the signal turned green, I continued through.
  The motorist in the first car stopped in order to yield to my right of way before proceeding with her right turn. I
  continued approximately 200 feet, when I heard a loud bang from behind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The third car, a red convertible, had rear-ended the second car. Instead of pulling off the street to exchange
  insurance information, the red convertible proceeded to swerve out of the right lane into the left lane, pass both
  the other cars back into the right lane, and aggressively run me off the road, his front
  bumper well into the bicycle lane. Did he believe it to be my fault he rear-ended another car?
  Did he just not have an insurance policy? What perverse cowardice
  could drive someone to such aggression?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day, as I was walking down the sidewalk on my way to the grocery store, a teenager yelled &amp;quot;Faggot!&amp;quot;
  out the window of his SUV as he sped by. Boy, he sure must have felt empowered, him and his big SUV and his homophobic
  slurs. I wish that poor, deprived, wandering soul the best of luck, because despite his bigoted demeanor, my own
  self-love and improvement-oriented attitude mean I'll live a happier, healthier life than the lowlife aggressor. While
  he digs outward, I dig inward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Aggression is the outward reflection of a person's insecurities and fears. The aggressor sees something in his victim,
  whether it be social status, intellectual ability, self-confidence, or physical prowess, which he either lacks or believes
  he lacks. Instead of looking inward and asking how he can possess the qualities of his victim, he chooses to belittle
  his victim's weaknesses. So, the next time you're a victim of aggression or bullying, just remember that it just means
  your aggressor is probably wrought with insecurity and misery because your stride is just that much better than his.
  Just don't get run over in the process.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Help me park my house!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src='/assets/images/help-me-park-my-house.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've decided that, based on location and other factors, I'd like to find another spot to park my
  tiny RV in Portland. Preferably, I'd like to be somewhere within the following boundaries:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;N:&lt;/strong&gt;
    South of Killingsworth St, east of Interstate Ave, north of Tillamook St.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;NE:&lt;/strong&gt;
    South of Killingsworth St, north of Tillamook St.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt;
    North of Powell Blvd, west of 12th Ave, east of Cesar Chavez Blvd
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  All I would ask is to use your electricity (via extension cord), to shower in your bathroom, and to use
  your laundry machines (if present). My RV is only 20'8", so it only takes up slightly more room than a
  standard parking spot. It's also downright adorable (pictured above).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Though what I'm envisioning is an arrangement as an auxiliary dwelling alongside an existing residence,
  I'd also be open to a spot in a parking lot, etc if I were close enough to a facility for bathing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Please spread the word! I'm willing to pay whatever the landowner or tenants think is fair. I'm quiet,
  considerate, and clean. Thank you for your support!
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">What I've learned after three months living tiny</title>
    <published>2012-05-19T17:25:09Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-19T17:25:09Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src='/assets/images/what-ive-learned-after-three-months-living-tiny.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's been about three months since my girlfriend and I trekked to Beaverton by bus
  to pick up the RV that I now call home. Since then, I've gone on a wild two-week
  roadtrip in my own house, transformed a modest RV interior into a luxurious palace on
  wheels, and learned so much about how to make the most of 100 square feet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;When you live in a tiny space, clutter's effects are amplified.&lt;/strong&gt;
    When I lived in my loft apartment, weeks would go by without giving the place a
    good decluttering. Bottles and cans from parties weeks ago would remain on my giant
    countertop. If I ate popcorn the night before, you'd likely find the remnants in my
    giant bowl sitting on my coffee table. In the RV, most surfaces serve many purposes,
    so there &lt;em&gt;simply isn't room&lt;/em&gt; for clutter. I do my dishes within a day
    &lt;em&gt;because I only have one plate.&lt;/em&gt; Everything has its right place, and if it
    doesn't, its misplacement will reveal itself as soon as I try to drive my house
    away and need to find a place to stow it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;When resources are limited, you curb your usage subconsciously.&lt;/strong&gt;
    My RV holds 20 gallons of fresh water and 19 gallons of waste, which is just enough
    to live one week comfortably before going to the dump station. Because of this
    inconvenience, I find myself turning off the faucet to conserve water more than I
    did in a brick-and-mortar home. It's amusing how barbaric and selfish we actually
    are when it comes to conservation, but I'll admit it took knowing my own supply
    is limited before I'd make a concerted effort in curbing my usage.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;My life is generally richer and more experience-driven.&lt;/strong&gt;
    When you live in 100 square feet, you're not occupied with the temptation to buy
    a new, swanky piece of furniture. Since I moved into the RV, I've found myself
    more eager to leave the house to explore, since I've stripped my house of frivolty
    and responsibility. No space for a couch means I'm less likely to vegetate during
    the daytime.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A small space is dirt cheap to maintain!&lt;/strong&gt;
    When I lived in my loft apartment, I was paying $1239/mo in rent, between $20-$100
    in electricity per month (it had electric forced air heat), and varying amounts
    in water and sewer usage. In the RV, my monthly expenses are $100/mo for my parking
    spot, about $25/mo for electricity, about $10/mo for propane, and $40/mo for waste
    disposal. That puts my monthly base living expenses at $175!
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A small space is cozy.&lt;/strong&gt;
    My RV is just a downright pleasant place to be. Most people assume because I have
    such a small space that I'm not comfortable. I think the opposite is true. My
    walls are closer together. Rather than the cold, vast cavern my loft often felt like,
    my RV feels like a small, warm cocoon.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Okay, so you're probably thinking there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be some serious drawbacks to tiny
  living. "Don't you wish you had more room once in awhile?" "Doesn't living in your car
  get old?" "Don't you wish you had a shower in your house?" Sometimes these thoughts
  enter my mind. But in all honesty, the feeling of self-sufficiency, resourcefulness,
  and ingenuity I derive from this lifestyle far outweigh the drawbacks. Quite frankly, I'm
  happier than I've ever been.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
