  I use Twitter predominantly to keep up with my other tech-saavy friends and colleagues. One
  trend I notice among this crowd is their (our?) continuing tendency to blog about The Next
  Big Thing in technology, as if its mere conception will vastly improve the lives of its users.
  We're not talking about a new cancer treatment, an anti-aging medication, an abundant energy source.
  Nope, we're talking about some new app that plugs into your Twitters to make it talk to your Instagrams
  and ensure your Facebooks are kept in sync. And goddamnit, I don't fucking care anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meta is misery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Technology is beautiful. It allows us to move at speeds unimaginable a century ago, communicate
  with almost anyone the world over instantly, and cure or prevent once pandemic-scale diseases. Talking
  about technology is healthy; it creates a diverse, useful community, without which we could not evolve
  our efforts. But I, like so many of my colleagues, have fallen to the plight of the Great Meta: Spending
  time (your valuable, precious, short lifetime) encouraging and criticizing current technology trends in
  an effort to be the coolest kid on the Internet. This practice is downright absurd, and should be banished
  from the face of the Internet for the good of humanity. Create and use technology to enrich your life,
  and let that be that. You're not making the world a better place by creating a new social network platform,
  no matter how much that sweet VC money fools you into thinking so.
&lt;/p&gt;

  It's been about a month since I began moving my life into the tiny RV I now call home. It's not
  a stretch to say that the last month of my life is probably in my top five life-changing experiences,
  right up there with moving out of my parents' house. Never has my daily consideration shifted so much
  in the direction of frugality and resourcefulness.

  I wanted to be able to eloquently test Backbone.js event chains, so I wrote a custom matcher:

  It's been raining and hovering around 40&amp;deg;F for the past two weeks straight here in Portland.
  As a result, my trusted land yacht (RV) has faced the plight of condensation in all its orifices.
  And so, I figured, my wet carpet must surely be a result of it raining inside, right?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The plastic tubing connecting my water pump to the faucet had sprung a slow leak, and was dripping
  water all over the inside of my kitchenette unit, down onto the carpet in front of my bed. I'd
  impressed myself countless times with my seeming natural handyman talent (this kid deals in bits and
  bytes typically), but this one was too much stress for me to handle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My trusty Craigslist contractor came to the rescue, but had a caveat: The carpets needed to be ripped
  out. With that much water seeping through to the subfloor, chances of salvaging the wood below with
  the carpets in place were slim. And so, reluctantly, I started the process I had hoped to put off
  until I reached sunnier pastures. It was time to go bamboo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wood Jerry! Wood!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  At the inception of my &lt;a href="/a-grand-lifestyle-experiment"&gt;grand lifestyle experiment&lt;/a&gt;, I decided
  I wanted to remodel most of my RV with gorgeous hardwoods from &lt;a href="http://bamboorevolution.com"&gt;Bamboo Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.
  Their work is most prominent in the interior of &lt;a href="http://coava.myshopify.com"&gt;Coava Roasters&lt;/a&gt;,
  with which they happen to share a space. When I saw it, I fell in love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The installation is still a work in progress, but I have a hunch the improvement will be night and day.
  I don't know what kind of masochist wants carpet installed in their home, but I'm glad to make a swift exit
  from that club.
&lt;/p&gt;
