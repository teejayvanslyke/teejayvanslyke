  Over the past few months, I've been busy authoring two brand new lifestyle ebooks on minimalism and creativity. I'm excited
  to share my experiences with you. Click the book covers above for more information about each!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Minify&lt;/em&gt; will teach you how to take inventory of your possessions, your time, your work, and your money and streamline each to maximize your lifeâ€™s experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In &lt;em&gt;Make Something Today&lt;/em&gt;, I provide an in-depth analysis of the positive life-changing effects of creativity on the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Both will be available this summer. Stay tuned, and subscribe to the mailing lists to stay informed!

&lt;p&gt;
  I'm proud to announce that, after months of being unavailable for high-quality MP3 download, Elias Moniker's
  debut album 'The A.K.A.' is once again available at the reduced sale price of $4.99!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For those of you unaware, I produced &lt;em&gt;The A.K.A.&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. It's a sinister, dubstep-influenced record and
  I put my heart and soul into it. Since then I've been on a bit of a musical
  hiatus with all my other projects, but I'd love to get the album into as many ears as I can.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Disable volume buttons on iOS using Activator</title>
    <published>2012-06-13T03:33:53Z</published>

  The other night, I stumbled while holding my iPad and knocked my volume-up button such that it now sticks, meaning the
  volume indicator is now stuck on-screen. Luckily, I devised a way to disable both volume buttons using the Cydia-based app
  Activator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To enable this hack, you'll need a jailbroken iOS device, the latest version of Cydia, and to have the Activator app installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inside Activator, tap 'Anywhere'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll to the bottom of the list to 'Volume Buttons'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap each item in the 'Volume Buttons' section and select 'Do Nothing'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Your volume indicator should disappear and you just saved yourself a trip to the Apple Store, or worse, the cost of a new
  iPad.

    <title type="html">Random acts of aggression</title>
    <published>2012-05-29T04:54:09Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-29T04:54:09Z</updated>

  &lt;img src='/assets/images/random-acts-of-aggression-05-28-2012.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The general consensus is that Portland is a relatively safe and tolerant city. Most of the time, my beliefs,
  appearance, and behavior are tolerated and accepted by most people. Either that or they're passive-aggressively keeping
  their mouths shut. Either way, altercations rarely arise, and when they do, they're resolved swiftly
  and peacefully.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  On Sunday, May 27, 2012, at approximately 3:00 pm, my faith in those convictions was shattered as I looked
  the fender of a speeding red convertible in the eye, contemplating, if only for a fraction of a second, the possibility
  that my life might be cut short by an unmeditated act of aggression. I was (and still am) reluctant to make the details of this incident public for my own safety, but I cannot help
  but share a synopsis as a friendly reminder that such aggression can happen here, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As I approached an intersection by bicycle, two cars queued in the lane
  beside me, followed by a third. As soon as the signal turned green, I continued through.
  The motorist in the first car stopped in order to yield to my right of way before proceeding with her right turn. I
  continued approximately 200 feet, when I heard a loud bang from behind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The third car, a red convertible, had rear-ended the second car. Instead of pulling off the street to exchange
  insurance information, the red convertible proceeded to swerve out of the right lane into the left lane, pass both
  the other cars back into the right lane, and aggressively run me off the road, his front
  bumper well into the bicycle lane. Did he believe it to be my fault he rear-ended another car?
  Did he just not have an insurance policy? What perverse cowardice
  could drive someone to such aggression?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day, as I was walking down the sidewalk on my way to the grocery store, a teenager yelled &amp;quot;Faggot!&amp;quot;
  out the window of his SUV as he sped by. Boy, he sure must have felt empowered, him and his big SUV and his homophobic
  slurs. I wish that poor, deprived, wandering soul the best of luck, because despite his bigoted demeanor, my own
  self-love and improvement-oriented attitude mean I'll live a happier, healthier life than the lowlife aggressor. While
  he digs outward, I dig inward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Aggression is the outward reflection of a person's insecurities and fears. The aggressor sees something in his victim,
  whether it be social status, intellectual ability, self-confidence, or physical prowess, which he either lacks or believes
  he lacks. Instead of looking inward and asking how he can possess the qualities of his victim, he chooses to belittle
  his victim's weaknesses. So, the next time you're a victim of aggression or bullying, just remember that it just means
  your aggressor is probably wrought with insecurity and misery because your stride is just that much better than his.
  Just don't get run over in the process.
&lt;/p&gt;
