&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I awoke Sunday morning to near-freezing temperatures in the parking lot of the Walmart in Yreka, California.
  Much to my surprise, I was the first RV to leave the lot in the morning. Armed with a fresh box of granola and
  unfettered by the bag of garbage and rotting produce left in the parking lot trash bin, I once again headed south
  on I-5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Snow turned to rain turned to green forests turned to barren desert, and before I knew it, I was at a truck stop
  in the Central Valley. It amuses me that entire towns form in California with the sole purpose of providing Interstate travelers
  with amenities. Also amusing is how unfazed these desert dwellers are by living an existence which would have proven impossible only
  a hundred years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And then I crossed the California Aqueduct. This is one of those fables I was told was true, but conveniently
  ignored. But there it was, a flowing network of oasises (oases?) feeding the fairytale city of Los Angeles,
  transforming temperate into desert and desert into temperate. According to Wikipedia, the California Water Project
  is the single biggest net consumer of energy in the state, despite it also being one of the largest producers.
  I'll put this in the categories of &lt;em&gt;very cool&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;totally not going to last another century&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I arrived in Monterey at around 5:00 pm and stopped off for some groceries; Big Sur is located on a stretch of
  US-1 with no outlets for miles, so if I wanted to eat more than pub food I had to ensure I was well-stocked. Monterey
  immediately struck me as a place I could stand to spend some time. Small-town, coastal mentality paired with
  a seemingly classic Californian aesthetic made it a place to which I'd like to return.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The drive along US-1 was both arduous and one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,
  probably second only to the last time I drove it. Last time, my vessel was a rented Mustang, and could
  maneuver the windy, tight turns with ease. This time, it was a bit of a different story. I don't know why
  motorists on US-1 would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go faster than 25 MPH. Speeds any greater don't provide the
  driver with an opportunity to dart their eyes westward at the coast's majesty. I must have pulled into four
  or five lookout points along the way to let Joe American and his American Family speed by to their next
  destination, racing as if he had to see the entirety of the California coast in only a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I arrived at my campsite and plugged in my land yacht as if it were a household appliance. I'm very
  eager to have her outfitted with solar panels so I'm not reliant on 110V power. I'm convinced that
  12V is the way of the future, and that portably powered microhomes are a means toward sustained
  energy independence. Anyway, my stay here has cleared my head, provided me with a fresh supply of
  oxygen, and allowed me to recharge before I plunge into the bowels of Southern California.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Today I embarked on the first leg of my journey to find America or some nice weather
  or whatever the hell I'm looking for barrelling down Interstate 5 at a whopping 45-65 MPH
  (my VW is a 4-cylinder; give me a break). I set my sights on the Mt. Shasta area of
  Northern California as a reasonable stopping point, and I sought to cross one particular
  nagging American dream off my very long bucket list. Tonight, I'm sleeping at Walmart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So far, my experience has been nothing but&amp;hellip;what I thought it would be. There's the overweight employees
  and patrons, not entirely unkempt but as 'kempt' as required by Sir Sam Walton. And then
  there's the haggard old woman waving hello to the greeter at the front door. Yreka is a
  town of fewer than eight thousand; I suppose everyone knows your name in a place like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's a bizarre feeling to drive into a Walmart parking lot and then realize you've got your
  entire house with you. As soon as I pulled in, I cranked on the propane and put on a pot of
  tea. Chamomile, to put me fast asleep to catch the first crack of sunlight pouring over the
  mountain. A Walmart patron might have suggested I take some 5-Hour Energy and push through
  till dawn, but I think I'll take their pimply-nosed complexion as a clear sign that sleep
  is a better option.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here's to a good night's rest.

  I use Twitter predominantly to keep up with my other tech-saavy friends and colleagues. One
  trend I notice among this crowd is their (our?) continuing tendency to blog about The Next
  Big Thing in technology, as if its mere conception will vastly improve the lives of its users.
  We're not talking about a new cancer treatment, an anti-aging medication, an abundant energy source.
  Nope, we're talking about some new app that plugs into your Twitters to make it talk to your Instagrams
  and ensure your Facebooks are kept in sync. And goddamnit, I don't fucking care anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meta is misery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Technology is beautiful. It allows us to move at speeds unimaginable a century ago, communicate
  with almost anyone the world over instantly, and cure or prevent once pandemic-scale diseases. Talking
  about technology is healthy; it creates a diverse, useful community, without which we could not evolve
  our efforts. But I, like so many of my colleagues, have fallen to the plight of the Great Meta: Spending
  time (your valuable, precious, short lifetime) encouraging and criticizing current technology trends in
  an effort to be the coolest kid on the Internet. This practice is downright absurd, and should be banished
  from the face of the Internet for the good of humanity. Create and use technology to enrich your life,
  and let that be that. You're not making the world a better place by creating a new social network platform,
  no matter how much that sweet VC money fools you into thinking so.

  It's been about a month since I began moving my life into the tiny RV I now call home. It's not
  a stretch to say that the last month of my life is probably in my top five life-changing experiences,
  right up there with moving out of my parents' house. Never has my daily consideration shifted so much
  in the direction of frugality and resourcefulness.
