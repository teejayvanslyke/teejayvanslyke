  I've been living out of my tiny RV for two months. My comfort level with the
  arrangement is growing steadily, to the point where I almost always get a good
  night's sleep in my vehicle. But there's still a nagging uncertainty amidst my
  gratification that I'll be caught and prosecuted for my behavior, the likes of
  which bears no harm upon others and has &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; of an environmental impact
  than a normal, modern living arrangement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I was in San Luis Obispo, I decided that its downtown core was much too alluring
  to spend my time driving between it and a campground on the outskirts of town. And so,
  despite its illegality, I spent the night in my RV parked on the street beside a
  law firm. I made sure my presence wouldn't upset anyone and kept my profile low. I
  awoke peacefully and didn't have any issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning over coffee, I executed a quick web search for &amp;quot;RV parking
  in San Luis Obispo&amp;quot; and came across &lt;a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/04/10/2023709/lawsuit-san-luis-obispo-homeless.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
  Turns out, SLO has enacted an ordinance banning RV camping from their streets in
  an effort to combat vagrantism and the drugs and violence that come with it. Yet
  another instance of combating a problem by enacting more laws, rather than approaching
  it with discretion and common sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I had three options. I could continue to spend my nights on city streets
  and risk being harassed by the police, I could find a campground on the outskirts of
  SLO and pay $45/night for 100 square feet of cement in an area with no amenities or
  attractions, or I could realize how unwelcome I felt and head home. I headed home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here in Portland, we're constantly at odds with how to deal with homelessness and
  vagrantism. Our downtown core is littered with their trash and our shelters have
  lines longer than swanky brunch cafes on a late Sunday morning. And yet, we continue
  to uphold laws prohibiting camping on public grounds and ordinances prohibiting
  long-term camping on private lots. In my short experience as a vagabond, my most striking
  observation was that my ability to be productive was drastically reduced when
  faced with the question of where I would sleep that night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now that I'm back in Portland and sitting pretty in my girlfriend's driveway while contributing
  my share of rent each month, I'm reminded that I'm still living an illegal lifestyle.
  Because of zoning ordinances in our city and most others, I've effectively erected a
  second domicile in a lot zoned for single-family occupancy, which if used regularly,
  constitutes a zoning violation. Luckily, I've got a laundry list of alibis if the city
  asks any questions. &amp;quot;This is my mobile office and I live in the house with my
  girlfriend&amp;quot; is what I'm sticking with for now. But the fact that I even have to
  &lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; having an alibi for completely harmless behavior (and in a time of
  increasing rent fees, one solution to the affordable housing problem) makes me cringe.
  Why should it be illegal for me to occupy a perfectly suitable dwelling on private property?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My RV lifestyle has granted me new perspective on homelessness and vagrantism.
  Despite my affluence and ability to get a hotel room or rent a house at a moment's notice,
  my reluctance to do those things means I face many of the same problems and vulnerabilities.
  I seek to live a happy, peaceful existence and have chosen minimalism as my path. It's too
  bad it's illegal to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's amusing to observe the patterns of my anxiety, as correlated with
  the weather and scenery. Portland's climate generally leaves me feeling
  depressed and wanting more. Its urban landscape is as near to perfect as
  an American city can be, but it might edge too far into the category of
  &amp;quot;major metropolitan area&amp;quot; for me to maintain a consistent semblance
  of sanity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Monterey's cool, sunny climate combined with its seemingly lacksidasical seafaring populous
  made it a damn near perfect place to reset my head. And now, being thrusted back
  into another major metropolitan area, I'm reminded why I left in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Every California city is comprised of equal parts slums, picket fences, and ugly car-oriented
  commercialism. Even Berkeley, a haven for progressivism, is a congested beheamoth of a place.
  Don't get me wrong: Californian urbanites are generally lovely people. It's just that
  the car-oriented, sprawling nature of their urban areas propagates a unique brand of
  California aggression. Everyone here is in a hurry to get somewhere, and when they're done
  being somewhere, they're in a hurry to get somewhere else. It's as if someone put blinders on their
  car windshields and they're living oblivious to the fact they live in the most beautiful
  place on earth. Or it's because one look out their car windshields means another In-N-Out Burger,
  strip mall, or traffic interchange.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If there were a brand name for this perpetual state of rushedness and instant
  gratification, it would be dubbed San Jose&amp;trade;. In less than 24 hours, I've witnessed
  a man in a Lexus blast his horn at a woman walking in a parking lot as if his weekend might
  be ruined if not for his on-time arrival at the local BevMo!. I've counted the BMW's, the Lexuses (Lexi?),
  the Mercedes-Benz's, and the sad, balding men who drive them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If there's one thing I've re-learned in my travels, it's that the most vital ingredient to
  happiness is what I like to call &lt;em&gt;experiential diversity&lt;/em&gt;. Nostalgic thoughts act as
  &lt;a href="http://veryevolved.com/2009/02/neuroscience-and-nostalgia/"&gt;natural antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;.
  Marketers convince you that their product or service will make you feel at home or
  bear resemblance to &amp;quot;the good old days.&amp;quot; They're just targeting
  the same part of the brain stimulated the first night home after a peaceful vacation or the moment two
  loved ones are reconnected at the airport. What advertising and commercialism &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; grant us
  is sustained diversity in experiences, thoughts, and ideas. If our hunter-gatherer roots aren't
  indicative enough of humankind's tendency toward exploration and conquest, then the blood-soaked founding of the United
  States should be. Denying our primal need to explore is to deny our humanity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Never let the people on television, in your computer, on billboards, or on the radio persuade you
  their way is the right way. It's a certainty they're trying to take your money, and it's a near certainty
  that they feel the same longing and entrapment as you do when you listen to them. I've found
  a new kind of fulfillment, and it comes from within.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Winds battered the side of my van through the night, perched
  atop a hill in Monterey County. I awoke to a rainy windshield,
  a crisp, dewey morning with a glowing potential to blossom
  into a beautiful sunny afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I spent Thursday and Friday working and cycling. The Laguna Seca
  Recreation Area is home to the Mazda Laguna Seca raceway, which served
  as a veritable road cyclist's utopia with its maze of paved and barely-traveled
  access roads around the campus. For two days, I cheerfully alternated
  between cycling and working every few hours. I hardly spoke to a soul, but this
  solidarity gave me new perspective.

  &lt;img src='/assets/images/laguna-seca-04-03-2012.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I awoke bright and early this morning&amp;mdash;5:30 is the earliest I've woken up voluntarily in years.
  After committing a couple hours of work, I packed up the RV and headed out. My first stop was one of
  two gas stations in Big Sur. And at only $5.25 per gallon, it was quite the bargain. The shopkeepers
  had a certain rural charm and genuine friendly demeanor that I'm not sure I've experienced elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My trip was to be simple in form, but burdensome in execution. Two hours driving, according to Google Maps,
  will carry an automobile from Big Sur to San Luis Obispo. What Google &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; know about was the
  rockslide and road closure I'd encounter a quarter of the way there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  US-1 runs along the perimeter of the Pacific coast. Outlets are sparse: There are stretches where one can drive
  forty miles without encountering a road leading inland. I was on one of those very stretches when
  I reached a &amp;quot;Road Closed&amp;quot; sign and a portly woman informing me (in that very same rural charm
  and friendly demeanor) that a rock the size of a large vehicle had fallen square into the highway, and
  that it was to be dynamited later that day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I set off in the northward direction, anxiously steering the windy, hilly intestine of the California
  coast. Since I enjoyed my grocery shopping experience in Monterey, I figured I'd set up shop in the area for the week.
  Monterey itself is quite a lot like all the California cities I've visited: Bright, car-crowded, noisy, yet still
  charming. I was tempted to try spending the night in my RV on a city street, but my waste tanks needed emptying
  and I wanted to retire to a peaceful place after the day's driving and working. I worked at a local coffee shop,
  bought enough groceries to last the rest of the week, and headed to Laguna Seca Recreation Area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Despite sharing land with a race track, Laguna Seca is a gorgeous
  hilltop campground with full hookups and just about the best view out your window you've ever seen. I'm very much
  looking forward to spending my workday atop a hill in the peaceful sunshine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I awoke Sunday morning to near-freezing temperatures in the parking lot of the Walmart in Yreka, California.
  Much to my surprise, I was the first RV to leave the lot in the morning. Armed with a fresh box of granola and
  unfettered by the bag of garbage and rotting produce left in the parking lot trash bin, I once again headed south
  on I-5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Snow turned to rain turned to green forests turned to barren desert, and before I knew it, I was at a truck stop
  in the Central Valley. It amuses me that entire towns form in California with the sole purpose of providing Interstate travelers
  with amenities. Also amusing is how unfazed these desert dwellers are by living an existence which would have proven impossible only
  a hundred years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And then I crossed the California Aqueduct. This is one of those fables I was told was true, but conveniently
  ignored. But there it was, a flowing network of oasises (oases?) feeding the fairytale city of Los Angeles,
  transforming temperate into desert and desert into temperate. According to Wikipedia, the California Water Project
  is the single biggest net consumer of energy in the state, despite it also being one of the largest producers.
  I'll put this in the categories of &lt;em&gt;very cool&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;totally not going to last another century&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I arrived in Monterey at around 5:00 pm and stopped off for some groceries; Big Sur is located on a stretch of
  US-1 with no outlets for miles, so if I wanted to eat more than pub food I had to ensure I was well-stocked. Monterey
  immediately struck me as a place I could stand to spend some time. Small-town, coastal mentality paired with
  a seemingly classic Californian aesthetic made it a place to which I'd like to return.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The drive along US-1 was both arduous and one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,
  probably second only to the last time I drove it. Last time, my vessel was a rented Mustang, and could
  maneuver the windy, tight turns with ease. This time, it was a bit of a different story. I don't know why
  motorists on US-1 would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go faster than 25 MPH. Speeds any greater don't provide the
  driver with an opportunity to dart their eyes westward at the coast's majesty. I must have pulled into four
  or five lookout points along the way to let Joe American and his American Family speed by to their next
  destination, racing as if he had to see the entirety of the California coast in only a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I arrived at my campsite and plugged in my land yacht as if it were a household appliance. I'm very
  eager to have her outfitted with solar panels so I'm not reliant on 110V power. I'm convinced that
  12V is the way of the future, and that portably powered microhomes are a means toward sustained
  energy independence. Anyway, my stay here has cleared my head, provided me with a fresh supply of
  oxygen, and allowed me to recharge before I plunge into the bowels of Southern California.
&lt;/p&gt;
