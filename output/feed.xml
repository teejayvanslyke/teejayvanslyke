&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've decided that, based on location and other factors, I'd like to find another spot to park my
  tiny RV in Portland. Preferably, I'd like to be somewhere within the following boundaries:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;N:&lt;/strong&gt;
    South of Killingsworth St, east of Interstate Ave, north of Tillamook St.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;NE:&lt;/strong&gt;
    South of Killingsworth St, north of Tillamook St.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SE:&lt;/strong&gt;
    North of Powell Blvd, west of 12th Ave, east of Cesar Chavez Blvd
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  All I would ask is to use your electricity (via extension cord), to shower in your bathroom, and to use
  your laundry machines (if present). My RV is only 20'8", so it only takes up slightly more room than a
  standard parking spot. It's also downright adorable (pictured above).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Though what I'm envisioning is an arrangement as an auxiliary dwelling alongside an existing residence,
  I'd also be open to a spot in a parking lot, etc if I were close enough to a facility for bathing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Please spread the word! I'm willing to pay whatever the landowner or tenants think is fair. I'm quiet,
  considerate, and clean. Thank you for your support!
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">What I've learned after three months living tiny</title>

  &lt;img src='/assets/images/what-ive-learned-after-three-months-living-tiny.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's been about three months since my girlfriend and I trekked to Beaverton by bus
  to pick up the RV that I now call home. Since then, I've gone on a wild two-week
  roadtrip in my own house, transformed a modest RV interior into a luxurious palace on
  wheels, and learned so much about how to make the most of 100 square feet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;When you live in a tiny space, clutter's effects are amplified.&lt;/strong&gt;
    When I lived in my loft apartment, weeks would go by without giving the place a
    good decluttering. Bottles and cans from parties weeks ago would remain on my giant
    countertop. If I ate popcorn the night before, you'd likely find the remnants in my
    giant bowl sitting on my coffee table. In the RV, most surfaces serve many purposes,
    so there &lt;em&gt;simply isn't room&lt;/em&gt; for clutter. I do my dishes within a day
    &lt;em&gt;because I only have one plate.&lt;/em&gt; Everything has its right place, and if it
    doesn't, its misplacement will reveal itself as soon as I try to drive my house
    away and need to find a place to stow it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;When resources are limited, you curb your usage subconsciously.&lt;/strong&gt;
    My RV holds 20 gallons of fresh water and 19 gallons of waste, which is just enough
    to live one week comfortably before going to the dump station. Because of this
    inconvenience, I find myself turning off the faucet to conserve water more than I
    did in a brick-and-mortar home. It's amusing how barbaric and selfish we actually
    are when it comes to conservation, but I'll admit it took knowing my own supply
    is limited before I'd make a concerted effort in curbing my usage.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;My life is generally richer and more experience-driven.&lt;/strong&gt;
    When you live in 100 square feet, you're not occupied with the temptation to buy
    a new, swanky piece of furniture. Since I moved into the RV, I've found myself
    more eager to leave the house to explore, since I've stripped my house of frivolty
    and responsibility. No space for a couch means I'm less likely to vegetate during
    the daytime.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A small space is dirt cheap to maintain!&lt;/strong&gt;
    When I lived in my loft apartment, I was paying $1239/mo in rent, between $20-$100
    in electricity per month (it had electric forced air heat), and varying amounts
    in water and sewer usage. In the RV, my monthly expenses are $100/mo for my parking
    spot, about $25/mo for electricity, about $10/mo for propane, and $40/mo for waste
    disposal. That puts my monthly base living expenses at $175!
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A small space is cozy.&lt;/strong&gt;
    My RV is just a downright pleasant place to be. Most people assume because I have
    such a small space that I'm not comfortable. I think the opposite is true. My
    walls are closer together. Rather than the cold, vast cavern my loft often felt like,
    my RV feels like a small, warm cocoon.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Okay, so you're probably thinking there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be some serious drawbacks to tiny
  living. "Don't you wish you had more room once in awhile?" "Doesn't living in your car
  get old?" "Don't you wish you had a shower in your house?" Sometimes these thoughts
  enter my mind. But in all honesty, the feeling of self-sufficiency, resourcefulness,
  and ingenuity I derive from this lifestyle far outweigh the drawbacks. Quite frankly, I'm
  happier than I've ever been.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <published>2012-05-17T19:40:09Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-17T19:40:09Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/our-automobile-epidemic/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Last night saw yet &lt;a href="http://bikeportland.org/2012/05/16/collision-at-sw-3rd-and-madison-leaves-woman-with-life-threatening-injuries-71838"&gt;another bicyclist death&lt;/a&gt;
  in Portland. And, as with most cyclist fatalities,
  Kathryn Rickson fell victim to a negligent motorist. Yet, somehow, the automobile remains the
  fabric of modern society. Despite its reputation as the leading cause of accidental death in the
  world, Americans are addicted to their cars. And it should be treated as much as an epidemic as
  smoking or obesity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I write all of this sitting in my three-ton RV, so you might call me a hypocrite. I love automobiles.
  They're great tools for traveling medium distances. But across America, automobiles are being
  misused as a means of transit for very short distances in densely-populated areas. Here in Portland,
  we advocate the bicycle as a healthy alternative to automobile transit. Yet our streets are still
  flooded with big, loud, noisy cars. Taking a walk usually involves having to be vigilant of two-ton
  aluminum boxes on wheels barreling down the street at 30 miles per hour. And this is normal?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Historically, city streets served as much as community meeting places as they did for transport.
  Streets are unique in that they are publicly owned like parks, but adjacent to private residences
  and businesses. Before the automobile (and on the very few designated car-free streets in America),
  streets were vibrant centers of collaboration and community. Why have we voluntarily surrendered our
  centers of community to the automobile?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We're so entrenched in car culture that the proposals I'm about to make will sound absurd. But, if
  enacted, I think we'd free our cities from the strangleholds of car traffic, noise and pollution in
  a profound way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Make parking unaffordable to non-residents.&lt;/strong&gt;
    In Portland, parking is generally abundant. With several downtown parking garages, generally free
    street parking, and friendly residential areas with tons of overflow spots, it's rare to think
    twice about driving because you won't have a place to park. If we enact a city tax on parking to
    the tune of $5/hour, you'll use public transit or a bicycle faster than you can say Hummer. Of course,
    residents should have parking permits for their neighborhoods excluding them from this tax. The
    point isn't to discourage car ownership--only to discourage traffic.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Reduce the maximum speed to 15 MPH.&lt;/strong&gt;
    Cars don't kill people. People with poor reaction time kill people. Currently, the City of Portland's
    default maximum speed limit is 25 MPH. While reasonable for car-only travel, cars traveling at this
    speed are still a nuissance to pedestrians crossing streets and bicyles attempting to maintain the
    flow of traffic among automobiles. Reducing the maximum speed would also discourage car use since
    bicycling would yield approximately the same trip duration.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Remove parking lanes from business districts and replace with combination of bicycle corrals&lt;/strong&gt;
    and sidewalks.
    All business districts in Portland, from Alberta St to Hawthorne Blvd to NW 23rd Ave, permit short-term street
    parking. Not only do cars parking on these streets cause a nuissance to other motorists and bicyclists
    passing through, but the line of cars littering curbs in these districts reduce the amount of livable
    community space open to businesses and citizens. By forcing patrons to park elsewhere, we would create
    peaceful, open-air pedestrian malls.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Require urban drivers to have a permit which must be renewed monthly.&lt;/strong&gt;
    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think if enacted properly, could be the best measure against unnnecessary
    automobile traffic. Want to drive in Portland? You'll need to have a sticker on your car saying you've
    paid your fee this month. Commercial vehicles might have an exemption from this policy since freight traffic
    is a necessary evil on our streets. But if you own a passenger vehicle and want to use it to go to work,
    the grocery store, or wherever else, you'll pay the price.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, I'm not an urban planner. I'm not sure of the unforeseen consequences of my recommendations. I'm merely
  starting the conversation about a post-automobile Portland. And, with enough support, I think we can make a dent
  in a problem more serious than any of us like to admit.

    <published>2012-05-01T17:16:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-05-01T17:16:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/using-data-attributes-to-elegantly-create-mixpanel-trackers/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been using &lt;a href="http://mixpanel.com"&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt; to track user behavior on one of my projects, and sought a more elegant way to track link clicks than the &lt;code&gt;track_links&lt;/code&gt;
  method the standard API provides. Instead, I'd like to be able to specify the tracker's name and properties as HTML attributes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Simply paste this snippet into your document ready block to get started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/2569284.js?file=gistfile1.coffee"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then, on any links you'd like to track, simply provide the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-tracker&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Specify custom properties in JSON using the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-properties&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-properties=&amp;quot;{agency: 'nasa', mission: 'apollo 13'}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This snippet will automatically redirect the user to the link's &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; after 300ms, so no
  need to worry if the Mixpanel request failed. Happy tracking!
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src='/assets/images/salad-04-26-2012.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  March was a turbulent month for my body and mind. I had just terminated the lease on my
  apartment in Portland and was in the process of moving into a tiny RV. Every day was rendered
  more burdensome by persistent rain, gloomy skies, and an unnerving sense that the rabbit hole
  of my anguish would burrow ever-deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I set out on the open road in a blaze of escapist glory, thinking I was destined
  to find happiness outside myself. At first, the distraction of the road combined with the
  glimmer of sunshine provided me with the fulfillment I so craved. But, as with all stints of
  pleasure, it was short-lived and transient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I returned to Portland, I sought to properly investigate the source of my anguish.
  Why did I find myself in a constant state of yearning and escapism? It wasn't my friends, nor
  my surroundings, nor the weather, nor my work. I had tailored each of those to my liking--moreso
  than for most people have the opportunity or will. If none of those things, then &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=00438A&amp;t=tjva-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;asins=B0053ZHZI2" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Fast-forward to this weekend. Within a 24-hour span, I discovered a film and a book, the likes of
  which would change my life. The film is the recently released, critically-acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/em&gt;.
  In it, the documentarian examines &lt;em&gt;The China Study&lt;/em&gt;, the famed 2004 book examining the relationship between
  the consumption of animal products and illness, in the context of the Western diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was well-aware my diet wasn't optimal, but I knew my attentiveness toward what I put in my gullet was more than
  most Americans, so I thought little of it. But when I realized that certain foods, in adequate daily quantities, could
  reverse diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and coronary artery disease, I was astonished and sought to completely
  revamp my diet to meet and exceed those criteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/em&gt; evangelizes a strict vegan diet and claims meat, dairy, and even fish are not necessary for, and
  often detrimental to, a healthy, disease-preventitive diet. Being a curious little bugger, I never let one driver steer me
  down the street. After all, veganism is generally regarded as a veritable tightrope walk to get adequate levels of B vitamins,
  and essential amino acids. Dr. Terry Wahls, a now-recovering multiple sclerosis patient, gave a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/KLjgBLwH3Wc"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; detailing the diet
  she used to kickstart her brain and find her way out of a wheelchair and walking again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, rather than eating out for two or more meals per day, I go to the grocery store shortly after waking up each morning,
  buy a bunch of dark leafy greens, one colored vegetable, one bunch of herbs, two pieces of fruit, and a bag of seeds or
  nuts of my choosing. All of this becomes the basis for two heaping servings of raw salad. You probably think I'm malnourished,
  but I've never felt so alert and alive. My craving for &amp;quot;mood enhancers&amp;quot; like caffeine, alcohol and cannabis have
  diminished substantially, almost to the point where I find their use to yield a net negative effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I've got my body on the path to proper nourishment. On to my spirit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=tjva-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1577314808&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=00438A&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Enter &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; by Eckart Tolle. Typically I don't gravitate toward mainstream
  bestsellers as the source for great inspiration, but there are always exceptions. This is a big one. Tolle
  has re-taught me the duality of being and self, a distinction I hadn't forgotten but one I had certainly
  neglected in my daily life. Whenever I find myself becoming anxious, fearful, or stressed, I focus my
  attention to the beauty of the moment I'm living. After all, the past and future only exist as recollections
  and projections in our minds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This led to another realization, the likes of which Tolle couldn't have discussed in his 1999 book but stares
  me straight in the face in our twenty-first century age. If past and future are mere products of ego, if self and identity
  are ailments of our own making, then what does social media represent in that context? The ultimate manifestation
  of our egos in digital form? Are all the texts, tweets, status updates, and constant social noise causing us
  anxiety of which we're hardly aware? Does the comment I receive on my Facebook post, pushed straight to my phone
  and ready for my consumption the instant it is published, the most iconic example of &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-presence,
  &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-attentiveness, and unconscious living imaginable?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Eat your fucking vegetables and be here now.
&lt;/p&gt;
