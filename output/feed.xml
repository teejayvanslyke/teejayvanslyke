    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Today I was riding eastbound on NE Ainsworth Street, just east of NE Martin Luther King Blvd in Portland, Oregon. As I always do
  in high-traffic situations, I remained in the middle of the lane to ensure all drivers could see me and to maintain a single
  line of traffic to avoid any confusion about whether all cars had passed. A blue Nissan was tailing me through the intersection.
  I planned on making a left turn on NE 7th Avenue, just a few blocks east.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Nissan honked their horn and tailgated me aggressively. I signaled to them to slow down. They then sat on their horn until I got
  out of the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Earlier today, a man in a red Chevrolet Impala was tailing me downtown, and swerved to pass on my right, an illegal maneuver in Oregon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When you drive a car, you're operating a weapon. If you're not willing to keep behind slower traffic, even if that traffic is pedestrian,
  stop driving and choose another mode of transit. Your day is no more important than anyone else's. Streets are public places to facilitate
  the safe transit of goods and people. If either of the drivers mentioned above had been riding a bicycle, they could have passed me
  without issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I will not stand by while you drive wrecklessly through my city. I have as much right to the road as you do. Your loud, dangerous, destructive
  car is taking innocent lives and slowly shaving time off your own. You'd be well advised to stop driving altogether. I don't care what your
  excuse is. If you commute to work, move closer or find a new job. If you have children, sell your car and buy them bicycles with the proceeds.
  I won't listen to your excuses because I've &lt;em&gt;made all of them myself&lt;/em&gt;. So shut up, do us a favor, and stop driving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Thanks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I'm proud to announce that, after months of being unavailable for high-quality MP3 download, Elias Moniker's
  debut album 'The A.K.A.' is once again available at the reduced sale price of $4.99!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For those of you unaware, I produced &lt;em&gt;The A.K.A.&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. It's a sinister, dubstep-influenced record and
  I put my heart and soul into it. Since then I've been on a bit of a musical
  hiatus with all my other projects, but I'd love to get the album into as many ears as I can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title type="html">Disable volume buttons on iOS using Activator</title>
    <published>2012-06-13T03:33:53Z</published>
    <updated>2012-06-13T03:33:53Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://tjvanslyke.com/disable-volume-buttons-on-ios-using-activator/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  The other night, I stumbled while holding my iPad and knocked my volume-up button such that it now sticks, meaning the
  volume indicator is now stuck on-screen. Luckily, I devised a way to disable both volume buttons using the Cydia-based app
  Activator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To enable this hack, you'll need a jailbroken iOS device, the latest version of Cydia, and to have the Activator app installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inside Activator, tap 'Anywhere'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll to the bottom of the list to 'Volume Buttons'.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap each item in the 'Volume Buttons' section and select 'Do Nothing'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Your volume indicator should disappear and you just saved yourself a trip to the Apple Store, or worse, the cost of a new
  iPad.
&lt;/p&gt;
