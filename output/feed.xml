    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been using &lt;a href="http://mixpanel.com"&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt; to track user behavior on one of my projects, and sought a more elegant way to track link clicks than the &lt;code&gt;track_links&lt;/code&gt;
  method the standard API provides. Instead, I'd like to be able to specify the tracker's name and properties as HTML attributes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Simply paste this snippet into your document ready block to get started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/2569284.js?file=gistfile1.coffee"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then, on any links you'd like to track, simply provide the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-tracker&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Specify custom properties in JSON using the &lt;code&gt;data-mixpanel-properties&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-tracker=&amp;quot;he chose to go to the moon&amp;quot; data-mixpanel-properties=&amp;quot;{agency: 'nasa', mission: 'apollo 13'}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go to the Moon!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This snippet will automatically redirect the user to the link's &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; after 300ms, so no
  need to worry if the Mixpanel request failed. Happy tracking!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  March was a turbulent month for my body and mind. I had just terminated the lease on my
  apartment in Portland and was in the process of moving into a tiny RV. Every day was rendered
  more burdensome by persistent rain, gloomy skies, and an unnerving sense that the rabbit hole
  of my anguish would burrow ever-deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I set out on the open road in a blaze of escapist glory, thinking I was destined
  to find happiness outside myself. At first, the distraction of the road combined with the
  glimmer of sunshine provided me with the fulfillment I so craved. But, as with all stints of
  pleasure, it was short-lived and transient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I returned to Portland, I sought to properly investigate the source of my anguish.
  Why did I find myself in a constant state of yearning and escapism? It wasn't my friends, nor
  my surroundings, nor the weather, nor my work. I had tailored each of those to my liking--moreso
  than for most people have the opportunity or will. If none of those things, then &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=00438A&amp;t=tjva-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;asins=B0053ZHZI2" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Fast-forward to this weekend. Within a 24-hour span, I discovered a film and a book, the likes of
  which would change my life. The film is the recently released, critically-acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/em&gt;.
  In it, the documentarian examines &lt;em&gt;The China Study&lt;/em&gt;, the famed 2004 book examining the relationship between
  the consumption of animal products and illness, in the context of the Western diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was well-aware my diet wasn't optimal, but I knew my attentiveness toward what I put in my gullet was more than
  most Americans, so I thought little of it. But when I realized that certain foods, in adequate daily quantities, could
  reverse diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and coronary artery disease, I was astonished and sought to completely
  revamp my diet to meet and exceed those criteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/em&gt; evangelizes a strict vegan diet and claims meat, dairy, and even fish are not necessary for, and
  often detrimental to, a healthy, disease-preventitive diet. Being a curious little bugger, I never let one driver steer me
  down the street. After all, veganism is generally regarded as a veritable tightrope walk to get adequate levels of B vitamins,
  and essential amino acids. Dr. Terry Wahls, a now-recovering multiple sclerosis patient, gave a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/KLjgBLwH3Wc"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; detailing the diet
  she used to kickstart her brain and find her way out of a wheelchair and walking again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, rather than eating out for two or more meals per day, I go to the grocery store shortly after waking up each morning,
  buy a bunch of dark leafy greens, one colored vegetable, one bunch of herbs, two pieces of fruit, and a bag of seeds or
  nuts of my choosing. All of this becomes the basis for two heaping servings of raw salad. You probably think I'm malnourished,
  but I've never felt so alert and alive. My craving for &amp;quot;mood enhancers&amp;quot; like caffeine, alcohol and cannabis have
  diminished substantially, almost to the point where I find their use to yield a net negative effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I've got my body on the path to proper nourishment. On to my spirit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=tjva-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1577314808&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=00438A&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Enter &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; by Eckart Tolle. Typically I don't gravitate toward mainstream
  bestsellers as the source for great inspiration, but there are always exceptions. This is a big one. Tolle
  has re-taught me the duality of being and self, a distinction I hadn't forgotten but one I had certainly
  neglected in my daily life. Whenever I find myself becoming anxious, fearful, or stressed, I focus my
  attention to the beauty of the moment I'm living. After all, the past and future only exist as recollections
  and projections in our minds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This led to another realization, the likes of which Tolle couldn't have discussed in his 1999 book but stares
  me straight in the face in our twenty-first century age. If past and future are mere products of ego, if self and identity
  are ailments of our own making, then what does social media represent in that context? The ultimate manifestation
  of our egos in digital form? Are all the texts, tweets, status updates, and constant social noise causing us
  anxiety of which we're hardly aware? Does the comment I receive on my Facebook post, pushed straight to my phone
  and ready for my consumption the instant it is published, the most iconic example of &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-presence,
  &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-attentiveness, and unconscious living imaginable?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Eat your fucking vegetables and be here now.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been living out of my tiny RV for two months. My comfort level with the
  arrangement is growing steadily, to the point where I almost always get a good
  night's sleep in my vehicle. But there's still a nagging uncertainty amidst my
  gratification that I'll be caught and prosecuted for my behavior, the likes of
  which bears no harm upon others and has &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; of an environmental impact
  than a normal, modern living arrangement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I was in San Luis Obispo, I decided that its downtown core was much too alluring
  to spend my time driving between it and a campground on the outskirts of town. And so,
  despite its illegality, I spent the night in my RV parked on the street beside a
  law firm. I made sure my presence wouldn't upset anyone and kept my profile low. I
  awoke peacefully and didn't have any issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning over coffee, I executed a quick web search for &amp;quot;RV parking
  in San Luis Obispo&amp;quot; and came across &lt;a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/04/10/2023709/lawsuit-san-luis-obispo-homeless.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
  Turns out, SLO has enacted an ordinance banning RV camping from their streets in
  an effort to combat vagrantism and the drugs and violence that come with it. Yet
  another instance of combating a problem by enacting more laws, rather than approaching
  it with discretion and common sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I had three options. I could continue to spend my nights on city streets
  and risk being harassed by the police, I could find a campground on the outskirts of
  SLO and pay $45/night for 100 square feet of cement in an area with no amenities or
  attractions, or I could realize how unwelcome I felt and head home. I headed home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here in Portland, we're constantly at odds with how to deal with homelessness and
  vagrantism. Our downtown core is littered with their trash and our shelters have
  lines longer than swanky brunch cafes on a late Sunday morning. And yet, we continue
  to uphold laws prohibiting camping on public grounds and ordinances prohibiting
  long-term camping on private lots. In my short experience as a vagabond, my most striking
  observation was that my ability to be productive was drastically reduced when
  faced with the question of where I would sleep that night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now that I'm back in Portland and sitting pretty in my girlfriend's driveway while contributing
  my share of rent each month, I'm reminded that I'm still living an illegal lifestyle.
  Because of zoning ordinances in our city and most others, I've effectively erected a
  second domicile in a lot zoned for single-family occupancy, which if used regularly,
  constitutes a zoning violation. Luckily, I've got a laundry list of alibis if the city
  asks any questions. &amp;quot;This is my mobile office and I live in the house with my
  girlfriend&amp;quot; is what I'm sticking with for now. But the fact that I even have to
  &lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; having an alibi for completely harmless behavior (and in a time of
  increasing rent fees, one solution to the affordable housing problem) makes me cringe.
  Why should it be illegal for me to occupy a perfectly suitable dwelling on private property?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My RV lifestyle has granted me new perspective on homelessness and vagrantism.
  Despite my affluence and ability to get a hotel room or rent a house at a moment's notice,
  my reluctance to do those things means I face many of the same problems and vulnerabilities.
  I seek to live a happy, peaceful existence and have chosen minimalism as my path. It's too
  bad it's illegal for me to do so.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's amusing to observe the patterns of my anxiety, as correlated with
  the weather and scenery. Portland's climate generally leaves me feeling
  depressed and wanting more. Its urban landscape is as near to perfect as
  an American city can be, but it might edge too far into the category of
  &amp;quot;major metropolitan area&amp;quot; for me to maintain a consistent semblance
  of sanity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Monterey's cool, sunny climate combined with its seemingly lacksidasical seafaring populous
  made it a damn near perfect place to reset my head. And now, being thrusted back
  into another major metropolitan area, I'm reminded why I left in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Every California city is comprised of equal parts slums, picket fences, and ugly car-oriented
  commercialism. Even Berkeley, a haven for progressivism, is a congested beheamoth of a place.
  Don't get me wrong: Californian urbanites are generally lovely people. It's just that
  the car-oriented, sprawling nature of their urban areas propagates a unique brand of
  California aggression. Everyone here is in a hurry to get somewhere, and when they're done
  being somewhere, they're in a hurry to get somewhere else. It's as if someone put blinders on their
  car windshields and they're living oblivious to the fact they live in the most beautiful
  place on earth. Or it's because one look out their car windshields means another In-N-Out Burger,
  strip mall, or traffic interchange.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If there were a brand name for this perpetual state of rushedness and instant
  gratification, it would be dubbed San Jose&amp;trade;. In less than 24 hours, I've witnessed
  a man in a Lexus blast his horn at a woman walking in a parking lot as if his weekend might
  be ruined if not for his on-time arrival at the local BevMo!. I've counted the BMW's, the Lexuses (Lexi?),
  the Mercedes-Benz's, and the sad, balding men who drive them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If there's one thing I've re-learned in my travels, it's that the most vital ingredient to
  happiness is what I like to call &lt;em&gt;experiential diversity&lt;/em&gt;. Nostalgic thoughts act as
  &lt;a href="http://veryevolved.com/2009/02/neuroscience-and-nostalgia/"&gt;natural antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;.
  Marketers convince you that their product or service will make you feel at home or
  bear resemblance to &amp;quot;the good old days.&amp;quot; They're just targeting
  the same part of the brain stimulated the first night home after a peaceful vacation or the moment two
  loved ones are reconnected at the airport. What advertising and commercialism &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; grant us
  is sustained diversity in experiences, thoughts, and ideas. If our hunter-gatherer roots aren't
  indicative enough of humankind's tendency toward exploration and conquest, then the blood-soaked founding of the United
  States should be. Denying our primal need to explore is to deny our humanity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Never let the people on television, in your computer, on billboards, or on the radio persuade you
  their way is the right way. It's a certainty they're trying to take your money, and it's a near certainty
  that they feel the same longing and entrapment as you do when you listen to them. I've found
  a new kind of fulfillment, and it comes from within.
&lt;/p&gt;
