&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Today I embarked on the first leg of my journey to find America or some nice weather
  or whatever the hell I'm looking for barrelling down Interstate 5 at a whopping 45-65 MPH
  (my VW is a 4-cylinder; give me a break). I set my sights on the Mt. Shasta area of
  Northern California as a reasonable stopping point, and I sought to cross one particular
  nagging American dream off my very long bucket list. Tonight, I'm sleeping at Walmart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So far, my experience has been nothing but&amp;hellip;what I thought it would be. There's the overweight employees
  and patrons, not entirely unkempt but as 'kempt' as required by Sir Sam Walton. And then
  there's the haggard old woman waving hello to the greeter at the front door. Yreka is a
  town of fewer than eight thousand; I suppose everyone knows your name in a place like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's a bizarre feeling to drive into a Walmart parking lot and then realize you've got your
  entire house with you. As soon as I pulled in, I cranked on the propane and put on a pot of
  tea. Chamomile, to put me fast asleep to catch the first crack of sunlight pouring over the
  mountain. A Walmart patron might have suggested I take some 5-Hour Energy and push through
  till dawn, but I think I'll take their pimply-nosed complexion as a clear sign that sleep
  is a better option.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here's to a good night's rest.

  I use Twitter predominantly to keep up with my other tech-saavy friends and colleagues. One
  trend I notice among this crowd is their (our?) continuing tendency to blog about The Next
  Big Thing in technology, as if its mere conception will vastly improve the lives of its users.
  We're not talking about a new cancer treatment, an anti-aging medication, an abundant energy source.
  Nope, we're talking about some new app that plugs into your Twitters to make it talk to your Instagrams
  and ensure your Facebooks are kept in sync. And goddamnit, I don't fucking care anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meta is misery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Technology is beautiful. It allows us to move at speeds unimaginable a century ago, communicate
  with almost anyone the world over instantly, and cure or prevent once pandemic-scale diseases. Talking
  about technology is healthy; it creates a diverse, useful community, without which we could not evolve
  our efforts. But I, like so many of my colleagues, have fallen to the plight of the Great Meta: Spending
  time (your valuable, precious, short lifetime) encouraging and criticizing current technology trends in
  an effort to be the coolest kid on the Internet. This practice is downright absurd, and should be banished
  from the face of the Internet for the good of humanity. Create and use technology to enrich your life,
  and let that be that. You're not making the world a better place by creating a new social network platform,
  no matter how much that sweet VC money fools you into thinking so.
&lt;/p&gt;

  It's been about a month since I began moving my life into the tiny RV I now call home. It's not
  a stretch to say that the last month of my life is probably in my top five life-changing experiences,
  right up there with moving out of my parents' house. Never has my daily consideration shifted so much
  in the direction of frugality and resourcefulness.

  I wanted to be able to eloquently test Backbone.js event chains, so I wrote a custom matcher:
