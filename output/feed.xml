  My friends are doing their best to support me. My girlfriend has been a guiding light through the process.
  My parents think I'm insane. Regardless of opinion, I'm now living in a 1995 Winnebago Rialta.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fat and unable to move&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was getting fat. Not around the waistline -- around my apartment. With two bicycles (down from four), three
  24"+ computer monitors, two computer workstations, numerous gadgets, a small studio's worth of music production
  gear, and a closet full of clothes I never wore, I was destined to live life reluctantly renewing leases for fear
  of moving on. &lt;em&gt;What would I do with all this stuff?&lt;/em&gt; The idea terrified me. It terrified me so much that
  I'd have nightmares about never being able to leave Portland. You know, the ones where Sam Adams erects a wall
  around the city and David Hasselhof tries to save us. Or something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Down by the river&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Rewind back to 2002. A simpler time. A time where a 17-year-old high school senior could make his daily allowance
  working for the local supermarket and dream about one day living in a van. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I could go anywhere, anytime!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;,
  I'd think to myself. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I could even install a computer inside, and wardrive for fresh wi-fi hotspots around town!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  But alas, vans cost thousands of dollars, and I didn't have any credit... or thousands of dollars. Dreams crushed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A fear of flight&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When I was in my early twenties, I'd fly everywhere without a thought. In 2008 I flew to and from Europe three
  times in the course of only a few weeks. I loved to fly. But then...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then this pesky part of my brain called my frontal lobe developed. All of the sudden flying was for the birds,
  stepping too close to the edge of cliffs was a death wish, and earthquakes were common in Portland, Oregon. And so
  ended my era of easy, fast transcontinental travel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Forever stranded 3,000 miles away from home, with an unnerving desire to see something different when I awaken in the morning,
  I decided it was time to fulfill my thkjeenage pipe dream. And so far, I've never been more fulfilled by a decision in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Criminally small&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Perusing the zoning ordinances for most urban areas, you'll find that the minimum square footage for a residence is somewhere in the
  vicinity of 400 square feet. You'll also find that (in Portland, at least) parking your motorhome on the street overnight is illegal.
  And then there's the city's camping laws, which prohibit camping in a private yard for longer than 14 consecutive days. In my opinion,
  these laws do more to disturb the peace than protect it.
&lt;/p&gt;

  I have fond memories of dreaming away during my teenage youth at the prospect of one day finding a way
  to make a living on the road. Of one day building my ideal vessel: A veritable hacker's paradise on wheels.
  And yet, somehow I've always found a way to excuse myself from the dream's pursuit and realization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Well not this year, damnit. That's right. In Summer 2012, I set sail on the open road in a yet-to-be-converted
  Sprinter van, equipped with most of the amenities of home and bearing one overwhelmingly novel feature no
  condo or apartment ever could: A V6 engine and a set of wheels.

    <title type="html">RVM, Ruby 1.9.3, Homebrew and PostgreSQL make me want to kill babies</title>

  After much frustration with absymal load times on my Rails 3.1 application when running on Ruby 1.9.2,
  I decided it was high time to upgrade to 1.9.3 to take advantage of its new hash-based require scheme. Turns out
  it was going to take an entire afternoon because of an issue with the &lt;code&gt;pg&lt;/code&gt; gem's configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you're having the same problem, try the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ rvm use 1.9.3-p0
$ gem uninstall pg # uninstall all versions
$ gem install pg  --with-pg-config=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/bin/pg_config&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Essentially, you need to be explicit about Homebrew's Postgres installation so you don't end up using
  the default Mac installation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  So I've noticed some things about my inner monologue when reading poorly-written prose:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;If someone misuses the word 'to' in place of 'too', my internal meter speeds up to accommodate the missing 'o'.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;What's up? Oh not to much.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Whenever someone writes in all capital letters, I shout the entire sentence to myself&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;HEY TEEJAY HOW'S IT GOING? I'M GOOD LOVE AUNT SHERRY&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;When someone uses the possessive pronoun "your" in place of the contraction "you're," I want to give my eyeballs paper cuts with acid blotter paper.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Boy I bet your glad I took that English class!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;And finally, when someone does all three at once, I write blog posts like this one!&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;YOUR REALLY GREAT AND WE SHOULD HANG OUT TO!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
