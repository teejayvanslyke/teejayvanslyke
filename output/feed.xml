&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's amusing to observe the patterns of my anxiety, as correlated with
  the weather and scenery. Portland's climate generally leaves me feeling
  depressed and wanting more. Its urban landscape is as near to perfect as
  an American city can be, but it might edge too far into the category of
  &amp;quot;major metropolitan area&amp;quot; for me to maintain a consistent semblance
  of sanity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Monterey's cool, sunny climate combined with its seemingly lacksidasical seafaring populous
  made it a damn near perfect place to reset my head. And now, being thrusted back
  into another major metropolitan area, I'm reminded why I left in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Every California city is comprised of equal parts slums, picket fences, and ugly car-oriented
  commercialism. Even Berkeley, a haven for progressivism, is a congested beheamoth of a place.
  Don't get me wrong: Californian urbanites are generally lovely people. It's just that
  the car-oriented, sprawling nature of their urban areas propagates a unique brand of
  California aggression. Everyone here is in a hurry to get somewhere, and when they're done
  being somewhere, they're in a hurry to get somewhere else. It's as if someone put blinders on their
  car windshields and they're living oblivious to the fact they live in the most beautiful
  place on earth. Or it's because one look out their car windshields means another In-N-Out Burger,
  strip mall, or traffic interchange.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If there were a brand name for this perpetual state of rushedness and instant
  gratification, it would be dubbed San Jose&amp;tm;. In less than 24 hours, I've witnessed
  a man in a Lexus blast his horn at a woman walking in a parking lot as if his weekend might
  be ruined if not for his on-time arrival at the local BevMo!. I've counted the BMW's, the Lexuses (Lexi?),
  the Mercedes-Benz's, and the sad, balding men who drive them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If there's one thing I've re-learned in my travels, it's that the most vital ingredient to
  happiness is what I like to call &lt;em&gt;experiential diversity&lt;/em&gt;. Nostalgic thoughts act as
  &lt;a href="http://veryevolved.com/2009/02/neuroscience-and-nostalgia/"&gt;natural antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;.
  Marketers convince you that their product or service will make you feel at home or
  bear resemblance to &amp;quot;the good old days.&amp;quot; They're just targeting
  the same part of the brain stimulated the first night home after a peaceful vacation or the moment two
  loved ones are reconnected at the airport. What advertising and commercialism &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; grant us
  is sustained diversity in experiences, thoughts, and ideas. If our hunter-gatherer roots aren't
  indicative enough of humankind's tendency toward exploration and conquest, then the blood-soaked founding of the United
  States should be. Denying our primal need to explore is to deny our humanity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Never let the people on television, in your computer, on billboards, or on the radio persuade you
  their way is the right way. It's a certainty they're trying to take your money, and it's a near certainty
  that they feel the same longing and entrapment as you do when you listen. I've found
  a new kind of fulfillment, and it comes from within.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Winds battered the side of my van through the night, perched
  atop a hill in Monterey County. I awoke to a rainy windshield,
  a crisp, dewey morning with a glowing potential to blossom
  into a beautiful sunny afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I spent Thursday and Friday working and cycling. The Laguna Seca
  Recreation Area is home to the Mazda Laguna Seca raceway, which served
  as a veritable road cyclist's utopia with its maze of paved and barely-traveled
  access roads around the campus. For two days, I cheerfully alternated
  between cycling and working every few hours. I hardly spoke to a soul, but this
  solidarity gave me new perspective.

  &lt;img src='/assets/images/laguna-seca-04-03-2012.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I awoke bright and early this morning&amp;mdash;5:30 is the earliest I've woken up voluntarily in years.
  After committing a couple hours of work, I packed up the RV and headed out. My first stop was one of
  two gas stations in Big Sur. And at only $5.25 per gallon, it was quite the bargain. The shopkeepers
  had a certain rural charm and genuine friendly demeanor that I'm not sure I've experienced elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My trip was to be simple in form, but burdensome in execution. Two hours driving, according to Google Maps,
  will carry an automobile from Big Sur to San Luis Obispo. What Google &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; know about was the
  rockslide and road closure I'd encounter a quarter of the way there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  US-1 runs along the perimeter of the Pacific coast. Outlets are sparse: There are stretches where one can drive
  forty miles without encountering a road leading inland. I was on one of those very stretches when
  I reached a &amp;quot;Road Closed&amp;quot; sign and a portly woman informing me (in that very same rural charm
  and friendly demeanor) that a rock the size of a large vehicle had fallen square into the highway, and
  that it was to be dynamited later that day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And so, I set off in the northward direction, anxiously steering the windy, hilly intestine of the California
  coast. Since I enjoyed my grocery shopping experience in Monterey, I figured I'd set up shop in the area for the week.
  Monterey itself is quite a lot like all the California cities I've visited: Bright, car-crowded, noisy, yet still
  charming. I was tempted to try spending the night in my RV on a city street, but my waste tanks needed emptying
  and I wanted to retire to a peaceful place after the day's driving and working. I worked at a local coffee shop,
  bought enough groceries to last the rest of the week, and headed to Laguna Seca Recreation Area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Despite sharing land with a race track, Laguna Seca is a gorgeous
  hilltop campground with full hookups and just about the best view out your window you've ever seen. I'm very much
  looking forward to spending my workday atop a hill in the peaceful sunshine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I awoke Sunday morning to near-freezing temperatures in the parking lot of the Walmart in Yreka, California.
  Much to my surprise, I was the first RV to leave the lot in the morning. Armed with a fresh box of granola and
  unfettered by the bag of garbage and rotting produce left in the parking lot trash bin, I once again headed south
  on I-5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Snow turned to rain turned to green forests turned to barren desert, and before I knew it, I was at a truck stop
  in the Central Valley. It amuses me that entire towns form in California with the sole purpose of providing Interstate travelers
  with amenities. Also amusing is how unfazed these desert dwellers are by living an existence which would have proven impossible only
  a hundred years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And then I crossed the California Aqueduct. This is one of those fables I was told was true, but conveniently
  ignored. But there it was, a flowing network of oasises (oases?) feeding the fairytale city of Los Angeles,
  transforming temperate into desert and desert into temperate. According to Wikipedia, the California Water Project
  is the single biggest net consumer of energy in the state, despite it also being one of the largest producers.
  I'll put this in the categories of &lt;em&gt;very cool&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;totally not going to last another century&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I arrived in Monterey at around 5:00 pm and stopped off for some groceries; Big Sur is located on a stretch of
  US-1 with no outlets for miles, so if I wanted to eat more than pub food I had to ensure I was well-stocked. Monterey
  immediately struck me as a place I could stand to spend some time. Small-town, coastal mentality paired with
  a seemingly classic Californian aesthetic made it a place to which I'd like to return.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The drive along US-1 was both arduous and one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,
  probably second only to the last time I drove it. Last time, my vessel was a rented Mustang, and could
  maneuver the windy, tight turns with ease. This time, it was a bit of a different story. I don't know why
  motorists on US-1 would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go faster than 25 MPH. Speeds any greater don't provide the
  driver with an opportunity to dart their eyes westward at the coast's majesty. I must have pulled into four
  or five lookout points along the way to let Joe American and his American Family speed by to their next
  destination, racing as if he had to see the entirety of the California coast in only a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I arrived at my campsite and plugged in my land yacht as if it were a household appliance. I'm very
  eager to have her outfitted with solar panels so I'm not reliant on 110V power. I'm convinced that
  12V is the way of the future, and that portably powered microhomes are a means toward sustained
  energy independence. Anyway, my stay here has cleared my head, provided me with a fresh supply of
  oxygen, and allowed me to recharge before I plunge into the bowels of Southern California.

  &lt;img alt='Walmart in Yreka' src='/assets/images/walmart-parking-lot-03-31-2012.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Today I embarked on the first leg of my journey to find America or some nice weather
  or whatever the hell I'm looking for barrelling down Interstate 5 at a whopping 45-65 MPH
  (my VW is a 4-cylinder; give me a break). I set my sights on the Mt. Shasta area of
  Northern California as a reasonable stopping point, and I sought to cross one particular
  nagging American dream off my very long bucket list. Tonight, I'm sleeping at Walmart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So far, my experience has been nothing but&amp;hellip;what I thought it would be. There's the overweight employees
  and patrons, not entirely unkempt but as 'kempt' as required by Sir Sam Walton. And then
  there's the haggard old woman waving hello to the greeter at the front door. Yreka is a
  town of fewer than eight thousand; I suppose everyone knows your name in a place like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's a bizarre feeling to drive into a Walmart parking lot and then realize you've got your
  entire house with you. As soon as I pulled in, I cranked on the propane and put on a pot of
  tea. Chamomile, to put me fast asleep to catch the first crack of sunlight pouring over the
  mountain. A Walmart patron might have suggested I take some 5-Hour Energy and push through
  till dawn, but I think I'll take their pimply-nosed complexion as a clear sign that sleep
  is a better option.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here's to a good night's rest.
